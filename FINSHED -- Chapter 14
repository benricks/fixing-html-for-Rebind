For many weeks I met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village. The elements, however, abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only made a dry bed for my feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide. For human society I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods. Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings, though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now. In some places, within my own remembrance, the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and children who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot did it with fear, and often ran a good part of the distance. Though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the woodman’s team, it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety, and lingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields stretch from the village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a foundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie the present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms House, Farm, to Brister’s Hill.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-i transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001">I made it through some fun snowstorms and had cozy winter nights by my fireplace, while the snow blew around outside and even the owl went quiet. For many weeks, I only saw people who came to chop wood and take it to town on sleds. But nature helped me make a path in the deep snow. When I walked through it, the wind blew oak leaves into my footprints. The leaves soaked up the sun and melted the snow, making a dry place to walk. At night, the dark line of leaves was my guide. For company, I had to imagine the people who used to live in these woods. Many in town remember when the road by my house was full of people talking and laughing. The woods around it had little gardens and homes, though it was more covered by forest than it is now. I remember when pine trees brushed both sides of a wagon at once. Women and kids who had to walk this way to Lincoln alone were scared and often ran part of the way. It used to be a simple road to nearby towns or for woodcutters, but it was more fun for travelers then because it had more variety and would be stuck in their memory longer. Where there are now solid, open fields from town to the woods, the road used to go through a maple swamp on a base of logs. Parts of those logs are surely still under the dusty road now, from what's now the poor farm to Brister's Hill.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">East of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of Duncan Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his slave a house, and gave him permission to live in Walden Woods;—Cato, not Uticensis, but Concordiensis. Some say that he was a Guinea Negro. There are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which he let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an equally narrow house at present. Cato’s half-obliterated cellar hole still remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the smooth sumach (<i>Rhus glabra</i>,) and one of the earliest species of golden-rod
        (<i>Solidago stricta</i>) grows there luxuriantly.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">Across the road, east of my bean-field, lived Cato Ingraham, a slave owned by Duncan Ingraham, Esq., a gentleman from Concord village. Mr. Ingraham built a house for his slave and allowed him to reside in Walden Woods. This was Cato of Concord, not Cato of Utica. Some say he was originally from Guinea, Africa. A few people remember the small patch of walnut trees he cultivated, intending to harvest them in his old age when he would need them. However, a younger, paler speculator eventually acquired the trees. Now, Cato also resides in an equally small house. His half-eroded cellar hole, known to only a few, remains hidden from travelers by a line of pine trees. The hole is currently filled with smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) and one of the earliest varieties of goldenrod (Solidago stricta), which grows there abundantly.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">Here, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a colored woman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the townsfolk, making the Walden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for she had a loud and notable voice. At length, in the war of 1812, her dwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole, when she was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together. She led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One old frequenter of these woods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon he heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling pot,—“Ye are all bones, bones!  I have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">Near the edge of my field, closer to town, a Black woman named Zilpha had her small home. There she spun linen for the townspeople, her high-pitched singing echoing through Walden Woods, for she had a powerful, remarkable voice. During the War of 1812, while she was away, her house was burned down by British soldiers on parole. Her cat, dog, and chickens all perished in the fire. She lived a difficult, somewhat cruel life. An old regular visitor to these woods recalls passing by her house one midday and overhearing her grumbling to herself over her bubbling pot, "You're nothing but bones, bones!" I've spotted bricks among the oak grove in that spot.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Down the road, on the right hand, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister Freeman, “a handy Negro,  slave of Squire Cummings once,—there where grow still the apple-trees which Brister planted and tended; large old trees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste. Not long since I read his epitaph in the old Lincoln burying-ground, a little on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers who fell in the retreat from Concord,—where he is styled “Sippio Brister, —Scipio Africanus he had some title to be called,—“a man of color,  as if he were discolored. It also told me, with staring emphasis, when he died; which was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived. With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told fortunes, yet pleasantly,—large, round, and black, blacker than any of the children of night, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord before or since.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">Down the road, on the right side of Brister's Hill, lived Brister Freeman, a skilled Black man who was once a slave in Squire Cummings. There, apple trees that Brister planted and cared for still grow; they are large old trees now, but their fruit still tastes wild and tart to me. Recently, I read his gravestone in the old Lincoln cemetery, slightly off to one side, near the unmarked graves of some British soldiers who died in the retreat from Concord. On the gravestone, he is called "Sippio Brister"—he had some claim to be called Scipio Africanus—and referred to as "a man of color," as if his skin was discolored. The epitaph also prominently displayed when he died, which indirectly let me know that he had lived at all. With him lived Fenda, his welcoming wife, who told fortunes in a pleasant way. She was large, round, and had a very dark skin, darker than any of the children of the night. She was a shadowy presence unlike any seen in Concord before or since.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">Farther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are marks of some homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once covered all the slope of Brister’s Hill, but was long since killed out by pitch pines, excepting a few stumps, whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">Further down the hill, on the left side of the old forest road, there are signs of an old Stratton family homestead. Their orchard used to cover the entire slope of Brister's Hill, but was long ago taken over by pine trees, except for a few stumps. The old roots of these stumps still provide the wild origins for many healthy trees in the village.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">Nearer yet to town, you come to Breed’s location, on the other side of the way, just on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named in old mythology, who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our New England life, and deserves, as much as any mythological character, to have his biography written one day; who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man, and then robs and murders the whole family,—New-England Rum. But history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them. Here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood; the well the same, which tempered the traveller’s beverage and refreshed his steed. Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the news, and went their ways again. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006">Closer to town, you'll find Breed's spot, across the street, right at the edge of the forest. This place is known for the antics of a demon, not clearly mentioned in old myths, who plays a big and shocking role in New England life. He deserves his own biography someday, just like any mythical figure. This demon first shows up acting like a friend or worker, but then steals from and kills the whole family—that demon is New England Rum. But history isn't ready to tell of the tragedies that happened here yet. Let some time pass to soften and add a blue tint to those stories. Here, a very unclear and questionable legend says a tavern once stood, with the same well that mixed the traveler's drinks and gave water to their horses. At this place, men would greet each other, share the latest news, and then go on their way.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">Breed’s hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long been unoccupied. It was about the size of mine. It was set on fire by mischievous boys, one Election night, if I do not mistake. I lived on the edge of the village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant’s Gondibert, that winter that I labored with a lethargy,—which, by the way, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint, having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the Sabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt to read Chalmers’ collection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly overcame my Nervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and in hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of men and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We thought it was far south over the woods,—we who had run to fires before,—barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. “It’s Baker’s barn,  cried one. “It is the Codman place,  affirmed another. And then fresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all shouted “Concord to the rescue!  Wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of the Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost of all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and gave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the evidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall, and realized, alas! that we were there. The very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to it; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless. So we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our sentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom’s shop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season with our “tub,  and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without doing any mischief,—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for Gondibert, I would except that passage in the preface about wit being the soul’s powder,—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are to powder. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">Breed's hut stood just a dozen years ago, though it had been empty for a long time. It was about the size of mine. On Election night, some troublemaking boys set it on fire if I remember correctly. I lived at the edge of the village then and had just lost myself in Davenant's Gondibert that winter when I struggled with lethargy. By the way, I never knew whether to consider lethargy a family issue. I have an uncle who falls asleep while shaving and has to grow potatoes in the cellar on Sundays to stay awake and keep the Sabbath. Or it might have been the result of my trying to read Chalmers' collection of English poetry straight through. It really got the best of me. I had just put my head down when the fire bells rang, and the engines raced that way in a hurry, followed by a scattered group of men and boys, with me among the leaders, as I had jumped over the brook. We thought it was far to the south over the woods—those of us who had run to fires before, whether barn, shop, house, or all together. "It's Baker's barn," one shouted. "It's the Codman place," another insisted. Then new sparks flew up above the trees as if the roof had collapsed, and we all yelled, "Concord to the rescue!" Wagons sped past with wild speed and heavy loads, carrying, perhaps, the Insurance Company agent, who was determined to go however far, and every so often the engine bell rang behind, slower but more certain. And last of all, as was later whispered, came those who started the fire and raised the alarm. So we kept going like true idealists, ignoring what our senses told us, until at a bend in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the fire's heat from over the wall, and realized, unfortunately, that we were there. The very closeness of the fire only cooled our enthusiasm. At first, we thought about throwing a frog-pond on it, but decided to let it burn, as it was so far gone and worthless. So we stood around our engine, bumping into each other, voicing our thoughts through megaphones, or more quietly mentioning the great fires the world has seen, including Bascom's shop. And among ourselves, we thought that if we had been there in time with our "tub" and a full frog-pond, we could have turned that threatened final and universal blaze into another flood. We finally retreated without causing any trouble—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for Gondibert, I would make an exception for that passage in the preface about wit being the soul's powder—"but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as Indians are to powder".</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">It chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following night, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I drew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family that I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was interested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to himself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river meadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth. He gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying down to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered, concealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes. The house being gone, he looked at what there was left. He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the well was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he groped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had cut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy end,—all that he could now cling to,—to convince me that it was no common “rider.  I felt it, and still remark it almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">The following night, around the same time, I happened to walk that way across the fields. As I approached the spot in the darkness, I heard a low moaning sound. I discovered the family's sole survivor, the inheritor of both their strengths and weaknesses, who was the only one concerned with this fire. He was lying on his stomach, peering over the cellar wall at the still-glowing embers below, muttering to himself as he usually does. He had been working far away in the river meadows all day and had taken the first opportunity to visit his childhood home. He looked into the cellar from every angle, always lying down to do so, as if remembering some treasure hidden between the stones, where there was nothing but a pile of bricks and ashes. With the house gone, he examined what remained. My presence alone comforted him, and he showed me, as much as the darkness allowed, where the well was covered up, which thankfully could never be burned. He groped along the wall for a long time to find the well-sweep that his father had cut and installed, feeling to find the iron hook or staple where a burden had been attached to the heavy end. It was the only thing he could now hold onto to prove to me that it was no ordinary rider. I felt it and still notice it nearly every day on my walks, for a family's history hangs by it.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">Once more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall, in the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return toward Lincoln.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">Once again, on the left, where the well and lilac bushes are visible by the wall, in the now open field, Nutting and Le Grosse resided. But let's go back towards Lincoln.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">Farther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches nearest to the pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his townsmen with earthen ware, and left descendants to succeed him. Neither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land by sufferance while they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the taxes, and “attached a chip,  for form’s sake, as I have read in his accounts, there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on. One day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a potter’s wheel of him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had read of the potter’s clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those days, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">Deep in the woods, where the road comes closest to the pond, lived Wyman the potter. He provided the townspeople with pottery and had descendants who carried on his craft. The potters were not wealthy because they lived on the land without truly owning it. The tax collector frequently showed up without success, just following procedure since there was nothing worth taking. One summer day, while I was out hoeing, a man delivering pottery stopped by my field to ask about the younger Wyman. He had purchased a potter's wheel from him long ago and wanted to know what happened to him. I was familiar with the biblical mentions of potter's clay and wheel, but I had never considered that our everyday pottery was made in the same way, rather than naturally grown like gourds. I was intrigued to learn that such a hands-on craft was practiced in my own community.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">The last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough,) who occupied Wyman’s tenement,—Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor said that he had been a soldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his battles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic. He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to. He wore a great coat in mid-summer, being affected with the trembling delirium, and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road at the foot of Brister’s Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when his comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle,  I visited it. There lay his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his raised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl broken at the fountain. The last could never have been the symbol of his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of Brister’s Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of diamonds spades and hearts, were scattered over the floor. One black chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden, which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing to those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was over-run with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm cap or mittens would he want more.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">The previous resident of these woods was an Irishman named Hugh Quoil (if I've spelled his name right). He was known as Col. Quoil and rumors suggested he had fought at Waterloo. If he were still alive, I would have asked him to recount his war stories. Here, he worked as a ditch digger. While Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena, Quoil found himself in Walden Woods. I only know the tragic parts of his life. He was a well-mannered man, seemingly worldly, and spoke more politely than one could keep up with. Even in the middle of summer, he wore a heavy coat, as he suffered from tremors and delirium. His face was a deep red color. Shortly after I moved to the woods, he passed away on the road at the bottom of Brister's Hill, so I never got to know him as a neighbor. I visited his house before it was torn down, when his friends steered clear of it, believing it to be cursed. His old clothes were curled up on his raised plank bed, as if they were him. His pipe lay shattered on the hearth, like a broken bowl at a fountain. The latter could never symbolize his death, as he admitted to me that although he had heard of Brister's Spring, he had never actually seen it. Dirty playing cards—kings of diamonds, spades, and hearts—were strewn across the floor. A single black chicken, which the administrator couldn't catch, as dark as night and silent, not even crowing, still roosted in the next room, waiting for the fox. Behind the house, there was the faint outline of a garden, which had been planted but never weeded due to his terrible fits, even though it was harvest season. It was overgrown with bitter herbs and beggar-ticks, which clung to my clothes as the only fruit. The fresh skin of a woodchuck was stretched on the back of the house, a trophy from his final battle, but he would no longer need a warm cap or mittens.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">Now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with buried cellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazel-bushes, and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some pitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black-birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was. Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry and tearless grass; or it was covered deep,—not to be discovered till some late day,—with a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the race departed. What a sorrowful act must that be,—the covering up of wells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears. These cellar dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where once were the stir and bustle of human life, and “fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,  in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed. But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this, that “Cato and Brister pulled wool;  which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012">Now only a dent in the ground shows where these homes used to be. Buried stones from the cellars remain, and strawberries, raspberries, thimbleberries, hazel bushes, and sumac plants grow in the sunny grass there. A pine tree or twisted oak stands where the chimney used to be, and a sweet black birch tree waves where the doorstep was. Sometimes the dent from the old well can still be seen, where a spring once flowed, now just dry grass. Or it was filled in and covered, not to be found again until years later, with a flat stone under the grass when the last people left. What a sad thing it must be to cover up wells, right when wells of tears are opening up. These dents from the cellars, like empty fox holes, are all that's left of the busy human life that used to be there. People debated ideas like fate, free will, and destiny in their own ways. But all I can find out about what they decided comes down to "Cato and Brister argued". That's about as enlightening as the history of more well-known schools of thought.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">Still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring, to be plucked by the musing traveller; planted and tended once by children’s hands, in front-yard plots,—now standing by wall-sides in retired pastures, and giving place to new-rising forests;—the last of that stirp, sole survivor of that family. Little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only, which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered, would root itself so, and outlive them, and house itself in the rear that shaded it, and grown man’s garden and orchard, and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up and died,—blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first spring. I mark its still tender, civil, cheerful, lilac colors.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013">The hardy lilac bush still thrives many years after the house it once adorned has vanished. Each spring it blooms with fragrant flowers for passing travelers to enjoy. Planted long ago by children in the front yard, it now grows wild in forgotten fields, outlasting the forests that rose around it. The last survivor of a bygone era. Those children never imagined the tiny twig they watered would outlive them, one day telling their story to a lonely wanderer fifty years after they had grown and passed on. Yet it blooms as beautifully and smells as sweet as ever. I note its delicate lavender hues, so gentle and bright.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">But this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while Concord keeps its ground? Were there no natural advantages,—no water privileges, forsooth? Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister’s Spring,—privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these, all unimproved by these men but to dilute their glass. They were universally a thirsty race. Might not the basket, stable-broom, mat-making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery business have thrived here, making the wilderness to blossom like the rose, and a numerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers? The sterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land degeneracy. Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the beauty of the landscape! Again, perhaps, Nature will try, with me for a first settler, and my house raised last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014">But why did this small village, the seed of something greater, fail while Concord remains? Were there no natural benefits, no water sources? Yes, the deep Walden Pond and refreshing Brister's Spring—the privilege to drink long and healthy gulps from these, all unused by the men except to water down their drinks. They were a universally thirsty people. Couldn't traditional crafts like weaving baskets, making brooms, crafting mats, roasting corn, spinning linen, and creating pottery have thrived here? These trades could have transformed the wild landscape into a flourishing community, with children taking over their parents' farms and continuing their legacy. The barren ground would have at least resisted the degeneracy of the lowlands. Alas, how little the memory of these human inhabitants adds to the landscape's beauty! Perhaps Nature will try again, with me as the first settler, my house built last spring now the oldest in the village.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">I am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy. Deliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose materials are ruins, whose gardens cemeteries. The soil is blanched and accursed there, and before that becomes necessary the earth itself will be destroyed. With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods and lulled myself asleep.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">I don't believe anyone has ever built where I live. Save me from a town constructed on the ruins of an older one, with gardens that are graveyards. The ground there is pale and cursed, and the world itself will end before living there becomes a must. With these thoughts, I filled the forest with imaginary people and drifted off to sleep.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016">At this season I seldom had a visitor. When the snow lay deepest no wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but there I lived as snug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts, even without food; or like that early settler’s family in the town of Sutton, in this state, whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent, and an Indian found it only by the hole which the chimney’s breath made in the drift, and so relieved the family. But no friendly Indian concerned himself about me; nor needed he, for the master of the house was at home. The Great Snow! How cheerful it is to hear of! When the farmers could not get to the woods and swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their houses, and when the crust was harder, cut off the trees in the swamps, ten feet from the ground, as it appeared the next spring. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016">During this time of year, I rarely had any visitors. When the snow was at its deepest, no one dared to come near my home for a week or two at a time. But there I lived as cozy as a field mouse, or like livestock that are said to have survived for an extended period buried in snow drifts, even without food. It reminds me of that early settler's family in Sutton, in this state, whose cottage was completely covered by the massive snowfall of 1717 when he was away. An Indian only found it by the hole the chimney's breath made in the snow, and thus rescued the family. But no kind Indian worried about me, nor did he need to, for I was safe at home. The Great Snow! How delightful it is to hear about! When the farmers couldn't reach the woods and marshes with their wagons, they had to chop down the shade trees in front of their houses. And when the snow crust was harder, they cut the trees in the swamps ten feet above the ground, as could be seen the following spring.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0017">In the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my house, about half a mile long, might have been represented by a meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks,—to such routine the winter reduces us,—yet often they were filled with heaven’s own blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a yellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into fir-trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl (<i>Strix nebulosa</i>) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way as it were with his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0017">In the heaviest snowfall, the trail from the road to my home, about half a mile long, could have been shown by a winding dotted line with big gaps between the dots. For a week of steady weather, I took the exact same number of steps, the same length each time, walking carefully and precisely in my own deep footprints. Winter makes us follow such routines, but often those prints were filled with the sky's own blue. No weather truly stopped my walks, or rather my venturing out. I often hiked eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to meet with a beech, a yellow birch, or an old friend among the pines. The ice and snow made their branches hang low and sharpened their tops, turning the pines into fir trees. I waded to the peaks of the tallest hills when the snow was almost two feet deep on flat ground, shaking down another snowfall on my head with each step. Sometimes I had to crawl and struggle there on my hands and knees after the hunters had gone to their winter camps. One afternoon, I entertained myself by observing a barred owl (Strix nebulosa) perched on one of the lower dead branches of a white pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight. I stood within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and crunched the snow under my feet but couldn't see me clearly. When I made the most noise, he would extend his neck, raise his neck feathers, and open his eyes wide, but his eyelids would soon fall again, and he'd start to nod off. After watching him for half an hour as he sat there with his eyes half-open like a cat, a winged feline brother, I too felt a sleepy influence. There was just a thin slit left between his eyelids, through which he kept a distant connection to me. With half-closed eyes, gazing out from the realm of dreams, he tried to make sense of me, a hazy object or speck that disrupted his visions. Finally, at some louder sound or my closer approach, he would stir restlessly and sluggishly shift on his perch, as if annoyed at having his dreams interrupted. When he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to an unexpected width, I couldn't hear the faintest sound from them. So, guided through the pine branches more by a subtle sense of their closeness than by sight, feeling his way through the twilight as if with his delicate wings, he found a new roost where he could peacefully wait for the dawn of his day.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0018">As I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows, I encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere has it freer play; and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek, heathen as I was, I turned to it the other also. Nor was it much better by the carriage road from Brister’s Hill. For I came to town still, like a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller. And when I returned new drifts would have formed, through which I floundered, where the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit’s track, nor even the fine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I rarely failed to find, even in mid-winter, some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial verdure, and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of spring.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0018">As I hiked along the lengthy railroad bridge spanning the meadows, I faced many a gusty and biting wind, as it blew freely there. When the frost nipped one cheek, I turned the other to it as well, pagan that I was. The road from Brister's Hill was hardly better. I still came to town, like a friendly Native American, even when the open fields' contents were heaped between the Walden road's walls. Half an hour was enough to erase the last traveler's tracks. Upon returning, new drifts had formed, which I trudged through. The busy northwest wind had deposited fine snow around a sharp bend, obscuring even a rabbit's tracks or a meadow mouse's tiny prints. Yet even in mid-winter, I almost always found a warm, spring-like marsh where the grass and skunk-cabbage persisted with eternal greenery, and a hardier bird sometimes waited for spring's return.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0019">Sometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at evening I crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door, and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house filled with the odor of his pipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I chanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the step of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my house, to have a social “crack;  one of the few of his vocation who are “men on their farms;  who donned a frock instead of a professor’s gown, and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barn-yard. We talked of rude and simple times, when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather, with clear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned, for those which have the thickest shells are commonly empty.</p>

I found his wood shavings on the hearth, and my house was filled with the smell of his pipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I happened to be home, I heard the crunching of the snow made by the footsteps of a wise farmer. He came from far away through the woods to my house, to have a friendly chat. He was one of the few in his profession who truly lived on their farms. He wore overalls instead of a professor's robe, and was just as ready to find the lesson in church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barnyard. We spoke of simple, old times, when people sat around big fires in cold, invigorating weather, with clear minds. And when there was no other dessert, we tried our teeth on many a nut that clever squirrels had long ago given up on, since the ones with the thickest shells are usually empty.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0020">The one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and most dismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a reporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a poet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his comings and goings? His business calls him out at all hours, even when doctors sleep. We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale for the long silences. Broadway was still and deserted in comparison. At suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter, which might have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the forth-coming jest. We made many a “bran new  theory of life over a thin dish of gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clear-headedness which philosophy requires.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0020">The poet was the one who traveled the farthest to reach my cabin, braving the deepest snow and gloomiest storms. While a farmer, hunter, soldier, reporter, or even a philosopher might be discouraged, nothing can stop a poet driven by pure love. No one can foresee when he will arrive or depart. His work summons him at all hours, even when physicians are asleep. Our small dwelling echoed with loud laughter and the hum of serious conversation, compensating Walden valley for the prolonged quiet. In comparison, Broadway seemed still and empty. At regular intervals, bursts of laughter erupted, which could have been equally attributed to the previous or upcoming joke. Over a simple bowl of porridge, we devised many new philosophies of life, blending the benefits of good company with the mental clarity demanded by philosophy.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0021">I should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome visitor, who at one time came through the village, through snow and rain and darkness, till he saw my lamp through the trees, and shared with me some long winter evenings. One of the last of the philosophers,—Connecticut gave him to the world,—he peddled first her wares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains. These he peddles still, prompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain only, like the nut its kernel. I think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive. His words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted with, and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve. He has no venture in the present. But though comparatively disregarded now, when his day comes, laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters of families and rulers will come to him for advice.—</p>

He still sells them, honoring God and shaming man, with his mind as his only fruit, like a nut and its kernel. I believe he must have the strongest faith of anyone alive. His words and attitude always assume a better world than most know, and he'll be the last to face disappointment as time passes. He has no stake in the present. But though relatively ignored now, when his time comes, unknown laws will take hold. Heads of families and leaders will turn to him for guidance.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">A true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old Mortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in men’s bodies, the God of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he embraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the thought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I think that he should keep a caravansary on the world’s highway, where philosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be printed, “Entertainment for man, but not for his beast. Enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind, who earnestly seek the right road.  He is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any I chance to know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of yore we had sauntered and talked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged to no institution in it, freeborn, <i>ingenuus</i>. Whichever way we turned, it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity. I do not see how he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023">A true friend of humanity and one of the only supporters of human progress. Like an immortal figure, with tireless patience and faith, he reveals the divine image imprinted on people's souls, the God of whom they are merely faded and crumbling monuments. With his welcoming mind, he embraces children, the poor, the mentally ill, and scholars, entertaining the thoughts of all while often adding some depth and refinement. I believe he should run an inn on the world's highway, where thinkers from all nations could stay, with a sign that reads: "Lodging for humans, but not for their animals. Enter, you who have free time and a calm spirit, who sincerely seek the right path." He is perhaps the most rational man I know, with the fewest quirks, and is always consistent. In the past, we had wandered and conversed, effectively leaving the world behind us, as he was not tied to any of its institutions, being freeborn and noble. Wherever we went, it appeared as if heaven and earth had come together, since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape. A man clothed in blue, most at home under the vast sky that mirrors his tranquility. I cannot imagine how he could ever die; Nature cannot afford to lose him.</p>

We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went grandly, like the clouds which float through the western sky, and the mother-o’-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there. There we worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and there, and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy foundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a New England Night’s Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of,—we three,—it expanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many pounds’ weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch; it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;—but I had enough of that kind of oakum already picked.</p>
