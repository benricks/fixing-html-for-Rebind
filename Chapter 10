Instead of calling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular trees, of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood, standing far away in the middle of some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or swamp, or on a hill-top; such as the black-birch, of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the yellow birch, with its loose golden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has so neat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details, of which, excepting scattered specimens, I know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the township, supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once baited with beech nuts near by; it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split this wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>, or false elm, of which we have but one well-grown; some taller mast of a pine, a shingle tree, or a more perfect hemlock than usual, standing like a pagoda in the midst of the woods; and many others I could mention. These were the shrines I visited both summer and winter.

Instead of visiting scholars, I called on special trees, rare in this area, standing in pastures, deep in woods or swamps, or on hilltops. Like the black-birch, with handsome two-foot wide specimens; its cousin the yellow birch, with a loose golden bark, fragrant like the first; the beech, with a neat trunk and beautiful lichen-painted details, of which only one small sizeable grove remains in the town, perhaps planted by pigeons once baited nearby with beech nuts; it's worth seeing the silver grain sparkle when split.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002"> Once it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow’s arch, which filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and leaves around, and dazzling me as if I looked through colored crystal. It was a lake of rainbow light, in which, for a short while, I lived like a dolphin. If it had lasted longer it might have tinged my employments and life. As I walked on the railroad causeway, I used to wonder at the halo of light around my shadow, and would fain fancy myself one of the elect. One who visited me declared that the shadows of some Irishmen before him had no halo about them, that it was only natives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us in his memoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had during his confinement in the castle of St. Angelo, a resplendent light appeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening, whether he was in Italy or France, and it was particularly conspicuous when the grass was moist with dew. This was probably the same phenomenon to which I have referred, which is especially observed in the morning, but also at other times, and even by moonlight. Though a constant one, it is not commonly noticed, and, in the case of an excitable imagination like Cellini’s, it would be basis enough for superstition. Beside, he tells us that he showed it to very few. But are they not indeed distinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all? </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">One time, I found myself standing right under a rainbow's arch. The colors filled the air around me, turning the grass and leaves vivid hues. It dazzled my eyes as if I was looking through tinted glass. For a brief moment, I was immersed in a sea of rainbow light, living like a dolphin in the colorful waters. If the experience had gone on longer, it may have colored my life and work in lasting ways. While walking on a railroad bridge, I was amazed by the glowing halo around my shadow. I liked to imagine I was one of the chosen few. A visitor once told me that the shadows of some Irish people he saw had no halos, claiming it was a trait only found in natives. In his memoirs, Benvenuto Cellini describes a similar phenomenon. After a terrifying dream while imprisoned in the castle of St. Angelo, he noticed a brilliant light appearing over his shadow's head in the mornings and evenings. This occurred whether he was in Italy or France, and was especially visible when the grass was dewy. This was likely the same effect I witnessed, which is most noticeable in the morning but can be seen at other times, even by moonlight. Although it's a regular occurrence, it often goes unnoticed. For an imaginative person like Cellini, it would be more than enough to inspire superstitious beliefs. Plus, he mentions that he revealed it to very few people. But aren't those who know they are seen at all truly special?</p>

I “hooked  the apples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in which many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already half spent when I started. By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine, piling boughs over my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one cast over the pickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste for shelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:—</p>

When I finally cast my line over the pickerel-weed, standing waist-deep in the water, I suddenly found myself in the shadow of a cloud as thunder started rumbling so loudly that I could only listen. The gods must be proud, I thought, using such forked lightning to drive away a poor unarmed fisherman. So I hurried to find shelter in the nearest hut, which was half a mile from any road but that much closer to the pond, and had been empty for a long time.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its father’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members of the family, too humanized methought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked “bogging  for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father’s side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his system,—and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher, or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were the consequence of men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study history to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman, (which, however, was not the case,) and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his family would live simply, they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge, and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight at an overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing so.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">The Muse tells stories. But there, as I discovered, lived John Field, an Irishman, with his wife and several kids. The eldest son helped his father at work, running from the swamp to escape the rain. The wrinkled, fortune-teller-like baby sat on its father's knee, peering curiously at the stranger. It didn't know it was John Field's poor, hungry child, not the last of a noble line. We sat under the least leaky part of the roof as it poured outside. I had been there many times before Field's family sailed to America. John was clearly an honest, hardworking, but aimless man. His wife bravely cooked countless meals in that tall stove, her round, greasy face still hoping for a better life. The mop was always in her hand, yet no results could be seen. The chickens, also sheltering from the rain, walked around like family members, too human-like to roast well. They stared into my eyes or pecked at my shoe meaningfully. As we talked, John shared how he worked hard "bogging" for a nearby farmer, digging up a field for ten dollars an acre. His cheerful son worked alongside him, unaware of the poor deal his father made. I tried to advise John, saying I was his neighbor who also fished and looked idle, but made a living like him. I lived simply in a snug, bright, clean house that cost little. If he wanted, he could build his own place in a month or two. I didn't need tea, coffee, butter, milk, or meat, so I didn't have to work hard for them. Since I ate simply, I spent little on food. But John started with those items, so he had to work more to afford them. After working hard, he had to eat more to recover, so it balanced out, or rather, he lost out and wasted his life. Yet he thought coming to America was a gain since he could have those foods daily. But true America is where you can live in a way that lets you do without such things, and where the state doesn't make you pay for unnecessary expenses from using them. I spoke to him as if he were a philosopher, wishing all meadows were wild if it meant people began to improve themselves. One needn't study history to know what's best for their growth. Alas, developing an Irishman is like a moral swamp-digging effort. I noted that his hard labor required thick boots and sturdy clothes that got dirty and worn out fast. Meanwhile, I wore light, inexpensive shoes and thin clothes, which some might think looked upper-class. In an hour or two of enjoyable fishing, I could catch enough for two days or earn a week's living. If John's family lived simply, they could all pick berries in summer for fun. John sighed at this, and his wife stared with hands on hips. They seemed to wonder if they had the funds or math skills for such a life. It was like navigating by guesswork for them, unsure how to reach port. So I guess they still face life head-on, fighting tooth and nail, unable to cleverly overcome its challenges - dealing with it roughly, like grabbing a thistle. But they battle at a huge disadvantage, with John living, sadly, without planning, and thus failing.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016"> “Do you ever fish?  I asked. “Oh yes, I catch a mess now and then when I am lying by; good perch I catch.  “What’s your bait?  “I catch shiners with fish-worms, and bait the perch with them.  “You’d better go now, John,  said his wife, with glistening and hopeful face; but John demurred. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016">"Do you ever go fishing?" I inquired. "Yes, I catch some fish occasionally when I have time; I get some nice perch." "What do you use for bait?" "I catch minnows with earthworms, and use them to bait the perch." "You should go fishing now, John," his wife said, with an eager and optimistic expression; but John hesitated.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0017"> The shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised a fair evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I asked for a drink, hoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my survey of the premises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one,—not yet suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I thought; so, shutting my eyes, and excluding the motes by a skilfully directed under-current, I drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are concerned. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0017">The shower had ended, and a rainbow over the eastern woods signaled a pleasant evening ahead. I took my leave, but before departing, I requested a drink, hoping to glimpse the bottom of the well and complete my inspection of the property. Alas, there were shallow areas and quicksand, with the rope broken and the bucket lost. In the meantime, the proper cooking pot was chosen, and water was apparently purified before being handed to me after much discussion and delay. It had not yet been allowed to cool or settle. I realized that such thin soup is what sustains life in this place. Closing my eyes and skillfully avoiding the floating particles with an undercurrent, I took the heartiest sip I could muster in the spirit of true hospitality. When it comes to manners, I'm not particular about such things.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0018"> As I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places, appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and college; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say,—Go fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow wild according to thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English hay. Let the thunder rumble; what if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to thee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land, but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying and selling, and spending their lives like serfs.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0018">As I left the Irishman's roof after the rain, heading back to the pond, my hurry to catch fish, wading in remote meadows, swamps, and wild places, seemed briefly unimportant to me, having gone to school and college. But as I ran downhill towards the setting sun, with a rainbow behind me, and faint ringing sounds carried to my ears through the fresh air from unknown places, my inner voice seemed to say: Go fishing and hunting every day, far and wide, and relax by streams and firesides without worry. Recall your Creator in your youth. Wake carefree before dawn and seek adventures. Be by other lakes at noon and let night find you at home anywhere. No bigger fields exist than these; no games are more worthy than those played here. Grow untamed as you are, like these reeds and ferns that will never be English hay. Let thunder boom - so what if it threatens farmers' harvests? That's not its message for you. Take cover under clouds while others run to wagons and barns. Don't make a living your job, but your joy. Delight in the land, but don't possess it. People are where they are, trading and living like slaves, due to a lack of initiative and belief.</p>

        Men come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where their household echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes its own breath over again; their shadows morning and evening reach farther than their daily steps. We should come home from far, from adventures, and perils, and discoveries every day, with new experience and character.

      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0037">Men return home uneventfully each night only from nearby places, where their family life feels stifling and repetitive; their routines are more limited than their dreams and aspirations. We should return home from distant lands, from exciting exploits and risks, and new learnings daily, with broadened perspectives and personal growth.</p>

        Before I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John Field, with altered mind, letting go “bogging  ere this sunset. But he, poor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while I was catching a fair string, and he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the boat luck changed seats too. Poor John Field!—I trust he does not read this, unless he will improve by it,—thinking to live by some derivative old country mode in this primitive new country,—to catch perch with shiners. It is good bait sometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his own, yet he a poor man, born to be poor, with his inherited Irish poverty or poor life, his Adam’s grandmother and boggy ways, not to rise in this world, he nor his posterity, till their wading webbed bog-trotting feet get <i>talaria</i> to their heels.

But the poor man only caught a couple fish while I reeled in a good amount. He blamed it on bad luck, but when we swapped spots in the boat, his luck changed too. I hope John doesn't read this, unless he learns from it. He tries to get by using outdated methods from the old country in this new land - fishing for perch with minnows. It works sometimes, I admit. With his limited perspective, he remains a poor man, destined to be poor. He inherited this Irish poverty and unfortunate lifestyle. Neither he nor his children will advance in the world until they get some help to lift them out of their bog-trudging ways.</p>
