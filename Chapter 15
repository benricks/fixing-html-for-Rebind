When I crossed Flint’s Pond, after it was covered with snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over it, it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of nothing but Baffin’s Bay. The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood before; and the fishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice, moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers or Esquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures, and I did not know whether they were giants or pygmies. I took this course when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room. In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, a colony of muskrats dwelt, and raised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad when I crossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard, where I could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets. There, far from the village street, and except at very long intervals, from the jingle of sleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard well trodden, overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling with icicles.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-w transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001"> When the ponds were completely frozen, they provided not only shorter paths to many places but also new perspectives of the well-known scenery surrounding them. As I walked across Flint's Pond after a snowfall, despite having canoed and skated on it many times, it seemed so unexpectedly vast and unfamiliar that I could only think of Baffin's Bay. The Lincoln hills towered around me at the end of a snowy field, where I didn't recall standing before; and the fishermen, at an unclear distance on the ice, slowly moving with their dog-like huskies, resembled seal hunters or Inuit people. In foggy conditions, they appeared as mythical beings, and I couldn't tell if they were giants or dwarves. I followed this route when I went to give a talk in Lincoln at night, not using any roads or passing any houses between my cabin and the lecture hall. In Goose Pond, which was on my path, a group of muskrats lived and built their dens high above the ice, although none could be spotted outside when I passed by. Walden, typically having little or patchy snow like the other ponds, served as my open space where I could stroll easily when the snow reached nearly two feet deep on the flat ground elsewhere, confining the villagers to their roads. There, away from the town streets and the sound of sleigh bells except on rare occasions, I glided and skated as if in a huge, well-traveled moose enclosure, surrounded by oak forests and stately pines, weighed down with snow or covered in icicles. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum, the very <i>lingua vernacula</i> of Walden Wood, and quite familiar to me at last, though I never saw the bird while it was making it. I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it; <i>Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,</i> sounded sonorously, and the first three syllables accented somewhat like <i>how der do</i>; or sometimes <i>hoo hoo</i> only. One night in the beginning of winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o’clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods, responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from Hudson’s Bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native, and <i>boo-hoo</i> him out of Concord horizon. What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself? <i>Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!</i> It was one of the most thrilling discords I ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"> On winter nights and days, I often heard the distant, melancholic hooting of an owl. The sound was so familiar, it seemed to be the native language of Walden Wood, though I never saw the bird while it called. I rarely opened my door on a winter evening without hearing it: "Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo," with the first three notes stressed like "how der do," or sometimes just "hoo hoo." One night in early winter, around nine o'clock before the pond iced over, I was startled by the loud honking of geese. Stepping outside, I heard their wings roaring like a storm in the trees as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond towards Fair Haven, seemingly scared off by my light, their leader honking rhythmically the whole time. Suddenly, a definite cat-owl from very close by, with the harshest, loudest voice I've ever heard from a wood creature, answered the geese at steady intervals. It seemed determined to reveal and shame this intruder from Hudson's Bay by demonstrating its greater vocal range and power, and to boo-hoo the geese out of Concord. Its call seemed to say, "Why are you disturbing the citadel at this hour that belongs to me? Do you think you'd ever catch me off guard at such a time, and that I don't have lungs and a voice just like you? Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!" It was one of the most exciting clashes I've ever heard. Yet, to a sensitive ear, it contained the makings of a harmony unlike any these fields had ever witnessed or heard before. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow in that part of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or I was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if some one had driven a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003"> At night, I often heard the ice on the pond making loud noises, as if it were my restless roommate in that part of Concord. It seemed like the ice was trying to roll over, bothered by gas and having bad dreams. Sometimes, I was woken up by the sound of the frozen ground cracking. It was so loud, it sounded like someone had driven a wagon right up to my door. In the morning, I'd find a long crack in the earth, stretching for a quarter mile and about a third of an inch wide. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Sometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust, in moonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into our account, may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men? They seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still standing on their defence, awaiting their transformation. Sometimes one came near to my window, attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse at me, and then retreated. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004"> On moonlit nights, I sometimes heard foxes roaming over the snow, searching for partridges or other prey. They barked roughly and wildly like untamed dogs as if struggling to express themselves, fighting to be free and run openly in the streets. If we consider the span of ages, could there be a society developing among animals as well as humans? To me, they seemed like primitive, den-dwelling men, still defensive and waiting to transform. Occasionally, one would approach my window, drawn by the light, snarl a fox-like curse at me, and then withdraw. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">Usually the red squirrel (<i>Sciurus Hudsonius</i>) waked me in the dawn, coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out of the woods for this purpose. In the course of the winter I threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn, which had not got ripe, on to the snow crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it. In the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal. All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by their manœuvres. One would approach at first warily through the shrub-oaks, running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful speed and waste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his “trotters,  as if it were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting on more than half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in the universe were fixed on him,—for all the motions of a squirrel, even in the most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girl,—wasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance,—I never saw one walk,—and then suddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same time,—for no reason that I could ever detect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect. At length he would reach the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile, before my window, where he looked me in the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a new ear from time to time, nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only the inside of the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground, when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a mind not made up whether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking of corn, then listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he would set out with it to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses, scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal, being determined to put it through at any rate;—a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so he would get off with it to where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005"> The red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) usually woke me at dawn, running over the roof and up and down the house, as if sent from the woods for this purpose. During the winter, I tossed out half a bushel of unripe sweet corn on the snow by my door and enjoyed watching the various animals drawn to it. The rabbits came regularly at dusk and night for a hearty meal. The red squirrels visited all day, providing much amusement with their antics. You'd start by creeping carefully through the scrub oak trees. Then you'd dart across the snow in quick bursts, moving like a leaf blown by the wind. You'd zip a few steps one way at incredible speed, then suddenly change direction. But you'd never go more than about eight feet before stopping again. It would then suddenly pause with a comical expression, as if the whole world was watching, wasting more time than needed to cover the distance, and then, quick as a wink, be atop a young pine, winding its clock and scolding imaginary spectators, chattering to the entire universe for no apparent reason. Eventually reaching the corn, it would select an ear, frisk about uncertainly to the top of my woodpile, look me in the face, and sit for hours, getting a new ear from time to time, nibbling voraciously at first and tossing the half-eaten cobs around. Growing pickier, it would play with its food, tasting just the kernels, until the ear, held by one paw, slipped and fell. This made the squirrel peer down with a funny, uncertain look as if the ear might be alive. It seemed unsure whether to retrieve it, get a new one, or leave. Pondering the corn, then listening to the wind, the impudent fellow wasted many an ear, until seizing a bigger one, he would balance it skillfully and set off to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo. In the same zigzag manner with frequent pauses, it dragged it as if too heavy and letting it fall diagonally, determined to take it at any cost—a remarkably silly and quirky character—and get it to his home, perhaps up a pine tree forty or fifty rods away, leaving the cobs scattered about the woods. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">At length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long before, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree, nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped. Then, sitting on a pitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills. They were manifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the squirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking what was their own.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006"> Finally, the jays show up, their harsh cries heard from far away as they carefully approach, moving sneakily from tree to tree. Getting closer, they pick up the nuts dropped by the squirrels. Perched on a pine branch, they try to quickly gulp down a nut that's too large, and then choke on it. After struggling, they cough it up and spend a long time trying to crack it open with their beaks. They were clearly thieves, and I didn't think much of them; but the squirrels, although initially cautious, carried on as if they were taking what rightfully belonged to them. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and, placing them under their claws, hammered away at them with their little bills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these tit-mice came daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile, or the crumbs at my door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles in the grass, or else with sprightly <i>day day day</i>, or more rarely, in spring-like days, a wiry summery <i>phe-be</i> from the wood-side. They were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn. The squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally stepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007"> Meanwhile, flocks of chickadees also arrived, picking up crumbs dropped by the squirrels. They flew to nearby twigs, placed the crumbs under their claws, and pecked at them with their tiny beaks as if the crumbs were bugs in tree bark. They did this until the crumbs were small enough for their thin throats. A small group of chickadees visited daily to find food in my woodpile or eat crumbs near my door. They made soft, quick chirping sounds that reminded me of icicles tinkling in the grass. Sometimes they'd call out with a lively "day day day," or on warmer days, I'd hear a high-pitched "phe-be" coming from the edge of the woods. They grew so used to me that one even landed on an armful of wood I was carrying and pecked at the sticks fearlessly. Once, a sparrow landed on my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt more honored by that than if I had worn a fancy shoulder ornament. The squirrels also eventually became quite comfortable with me, sometimes even stepping on my shoe when it was the closest path. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">When the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of winter, when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust; for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, “sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two.  I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of the woods at sunset to “bud  the wild apple-trees. They will come regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed, at any rate. It is Nature’s own bird which lives on buds and diet-drink.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008"> When the ground was not yet fully covered, and again near the end of winter, when the snow had melted on my south-facing hill and around my woodpile, the partridges emerged from the forest in the mornings and evenings to eat there. Whichever direction you walk in the woods, the partridge bursts away on fluttering wings, knocking the snow from the dry leaves and twigs above, which falls down in the sunlight like golden dust; for this courageous bird is not easily frightened by winter. It is often buried by snow drifts, and, it is said, "sometimes dives from the air into the soft snow, where it stays hidden for a day or two". I used to flush them out in the open land too, where they had left the woods at dusk to "bud" the wild apple trees. They will return regularly each evening to specific trees, where the clever hunter waits for them, and the distant orchards bordering the woods suffer quite a bit as a result. I am pleased that the partridge is able to find food, in any case. It is Nature's own bird that survives on buds and natural sustenance. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">In dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the hunting horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods ring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond, nor following pack pursuing their Actæon. And perhaps at evening I see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if he would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him; but, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen till they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts, where the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a wall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return to the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the scent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and circle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if afflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for this. One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by himself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for every time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking, “What do you do here?  He had lost a dog, but found a man.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009"> On gloomy winter mornings or short winter afternoons, I occasionally heard a group of hounds weaving through the woods with howling cries and yelps, unable to resist their chasing instinct. The sound of the hunting horn rang out at times, indicating that men followed behind. The forest echoed with their calls, yet no fox emerged into the open area by the pond, with no pursuing pack chasing after their prey. Perhaps in the evening, I would see the hunters coming back with a single fox tail hanging from their sled as a prize, heading to their lodge. They say that if the fox stayed underground, he would remain safe. Or if he ran away in a straight path, no hound could catch him. But after leaving his chasers far behind, he pauses to rest and listen for their approach. And when he does run, he loops back to his familiar territory where the hunters lie in wait. However, sometimes he will run along a wall for a good distance before jumping off to the side, seeming to know that water won't hold his scent. A hunter once told me he saw a fox being chased by hounds run out onto the frozen Walden Pond when shallow puddles covered the ice. The fox ran part way across before circling back to the same shore. The hounds soon arrived but lost the scent there. At times, a pack hunting alone would go past my door and circle my cabin, yapping and howling without paying me any attention, as if overcome by a kind of madness that prevented anything from interrupting their chase. They loop around until finding the fresh trail of a fox, as a clever hound will abandon anything else for that. One day, a man from Lexington came to my small cabin looking for his hound that left large tracks and had been hunting solo for a week. But I'm afraid he didn't gain much wisdom from what I told him, as each time I tried to answer his questions, he would interrupt me to ask, "What do you do here?" He had lost a dog but found a man instead. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">One old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in Walden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times looked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked the Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him. Some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit, hunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods. Late in the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden, he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still pursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well-Meadow, now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still and listened to their music, so sweet to a hunter’s ear, when suddenly the fox appeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and still, keeping the ground, leaving his pursuers far behind; and, leaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, with his back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the latter’s arm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled, and <i>whang!</i>—the fox rolling over the rock lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by the mystery. Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and the mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he skinned the fox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the woods again. That evening a Weston Squire came to the Concord hunter’s cottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined it and departed. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house for the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure early in the morning.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010"> An old hunter with a dry mouth, who used to bathe in Walden when the water was warmest each year, visited me and shared a story from many years ago. One afternoon, he took his gun and went for a walk in Walden Wood. As he strolled the Wayland road, he heard approaching hounds. Suddenly, a fox jumped over the wall into the road and quickly leaped over the other wall, dodging his fast bullet. An old hound and her three pups followed in hot pursuit, hunting independently, before vanishing back into the woods. Late that afternoon, while resting in the dense woods south of Walden, he heard the hounds' cries far off near Fair Haven, still chasing the fox. They came closer, their howling that filled the woods growing louder, now from Well-Meadow, then the Baker Farm. He listened to their delightful music for a hunter's ears. Abruptly, the fox appeared, calmly threading the serious paths, his sound masked by rustling leaves, quick and quiet, staying low, far ahead of his chasers. The fox jumped on a rock in the woods, sitting tall and alert, his back to the hunter. Briefly, compassion held back the man's arm, but the feeling passed fast. In a flash, his gun was aimed and bang! The fox tumbled over the rock, dead on the ground. The hunter held his position, listening to the hounds. They kept coming until the close woods echoed with their wild cries. Finally, the old hound burst forth, nose down, biting the air like she was possessed. She ran straight to the rock but froze upon seeing the dead fox, suddenly silent as if shocked, walking around him quietly. One by one, her pups came and also fell into confused silence. The hunter then stepped forward, surrounded by the dogs, explaining the situation. They watched quietly as he skinned the fox, briefly followed the tail, and eventually returned to the woods. That night, a Weston Squire visited the Concord hunter's home looking for his hounds. He explained they had been hunting solo from Weston Woods for a week. The Concord hunter shared what he knew and presented the skin, but the Squire refused it and left. He didn't locate his hounds that evening. However, the next day he discovered they had crossed the river and stayed at a farmhouse for the night where they were well-fed before leaving early in the morning. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">The hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to hunt bears on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in Concord village; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there. Nutting had a famous fox-hound named Burgoyne,—he pronounced it Bugine,—which my informant used to borrow. In the “Wast Book  of an old trader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and representative, I find the following entry. Jan. 18th, 1742–3, “John Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0—2—3;  they are not now found here; and in his ledger, Feb. 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit “by ½ a Catt skin 0—1—4½;  of course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble game. Credit is given for deer skins also, and they were daily sold. One man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here. I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the road-side and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011"> The hunter who shared this story recalled a man named Sam Nutting, who hunted bears at Fair Haven Ledges and traded their pelts for alcohol in Concord village. Nutting even claimed to have spotted a moose in the area. He owned a well-known fox-hound called Burgoyne, which my source would sometimes borrow. In the records of a former trader, captain, town-clerk, and representative of this town, I discovered these notes. On January 18, 1742–3, "John Melven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0—2—3;" gray foxes are no longer seen here. And in his ledger, on February 7, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton is credited "by ½ a Catt skin 0—1—4½;" certainly a wild-cat, as Stratton was a sergeant in the old French war and would not have been recognized for hunting less impressive game. Deer skins were also credited and sold daily. One person still keeps the antlers of the last deer killed nearby, while another describes the specifics of the hunt his uncle participated in. Hunters were once a large and cheerful group in this area. I vividly recall one lean Nimrod who would pick up a leaf along the road and play a tune on it that was wilder and more beautiful, if my memory is correct than any hunting-horn. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">At midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my path prowling about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if afraid, and stand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012"> On moonlit nights around 12am, I occasionally encountered dogs in the forest, sneaking about. They would slink off to the side, seemingly scared, and wait quietly in the shrubs until I walked by. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">Squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were scores of pitch-pines around my house, from one to four inches in diameter, which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter,—a Norwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other diet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summer, and many of them had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after another winter such were without exception dead. It is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner, gnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013"> Squirrels and mice fought over my nut supply. Dozens of pine trees around my house, one to four inches thick, had been chewed by mice the winter before. It was a harsh winter for them, with deep snow for a long time. They had to eat a lot of pine bark along with their usual food. The trees seemed healthy in the middle of summer, and many had grown a foot, even with the bark chewed all the way around. But after another winter, all of those trees were dead without exception. It's surprising that one mouse can eat a whole pine tree, chewing around it instead of up and down. But maybe this is how the pine trees, which tend to grow close together, get thinned out. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">The hares (<i>Lepus Americanus</i>) were very familiar. One had her form under my house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir,—thump, thump, thump, striking her head against the floor timbers in her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still. Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo, away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow crust, straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me and itself,—the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its nature. (<i>Lepus</i>, <i>levipes</i>, light-foot, some think.)

      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014"> The rabbits (Lepus Americanus) were very common. One had her den under my house all winter, separated from me only by the floor, and she startled me each morning by her quick departure when I began to move—thump, thump, thump, hitting her head against the floorboards in her rush. They often came around my door at dusk to eat the potato peels I had thrown out, and they blended in so well with the ground that they were nearly impossible to see when motionless. Sometimes in the fading light I would lose and then spot one sitting still under my window. When I opened my door in the evening, they would dart off with a squeak and a hop. Up close, they only made me feel sorry for them. One evening, one sat by my door just two steps away, at first shaking with fear, yet reluctant to move; a poor tiny creature, thin and bony, with torn ears and a pointed nose, a meager tail, and slim paws. It seemed as if Nature no longer held the lineage of nobler breeds, but was on her last legs. Its large eyes looked young and sickly, almost swollen. I took a step, and in a flash, it sped off with a springy leap over the snow crust, stretching out its body and limbs into an elegant shape, and quickly put the woods between itself and me—the wild, unrestrained deer, proclaiming its strength and the majesty of Nature. Its slimness was not without cause. Such was its essence. (Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some believe.) </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">What is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are among the most simple and indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable families known to antiquity as to modern times; of the very hue and substance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to the ground,—and to one another; it is either winged or it is legged. It is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away, only a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves. The partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive, like true natives of the soil, whatever revolutions occur. If the forest is cut off, the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they become more numerous than ever. That must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and around every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences and horse-hair snares, which some cow-boy tends.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015"> What is a land without rabbits and partridges? They are some of the most basic and native animals, known to people long ago and today. They have the color and essence of nature, closely related to the leaves and soil—and to each other. One has wings, the other has legs. It's hardly surprising to see a rabbit or partridge dart away. It’s as expected as rustling leaves. Partridges and rabbits still flourish, like true natives, no matter what changes happen. If the woods are cleared, the new growth that sprouts up gives them cover, and their numbers increase. It must be a truly poor country that can't support a hare. Our forests are full of both, and around each marsh you can find rabbit or partridge paths, lined with stick fences and snares of horsehair, tended by some young herder. </p>
