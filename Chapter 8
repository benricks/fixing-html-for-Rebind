Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which, taken in homœopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over to a neighbor’s to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their habits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side, to support it, as once at Redding &amp; Company’s on State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful to hear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as if to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was in the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the village were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank; and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one another, so that every traveller had to run the gantlet, and every man, woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts, where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure him; some to catch him by the appetite, as the tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the jeweller’s; and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the most part I escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gantlet, or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, “loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept out of danger.  Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even accustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well entertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of news, what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether the world was likely to hold together much longer, I was let out through the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-a transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001"><span class="first-letter first-letter-a first-letter-without-punctuation">A</span>fter working or reading and writing in the morning, I usually swam in the pond, crossing one of its coves and washing away the day's labor, leaving the afternoon free. Every couple days I walked to the village to hear the gossip that constantly circulated by word of mouth or in newspapers, which in small doses was as refreshing as the sound of leaves and frogs. Just as I strolled in the woods to see birds and squirrels, I walked in the village to observe the men and boys; instead of wind in the pines I heard the rattle of carts. In one direction from my house was a muskrat colony in the river meadows; in the other direction was a village of busy men, as intriguing to me as prairie dogs, each at their burrow or visiting a neighbor to chat. I went there often to watch their habits. The village seemed like a great newsroom, with nuts, raisins, salt, meal and other groceries sold on one side to support it. Some have such a huge appetite for news, and such strong digestion, that they can sit endlessly in public, letting it simmer through them like summer winds, only causing numbness and insensitivity to pain, without impacting their awareness. When I walked through the village, I almost always saw a row of such men, either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, bodies leaning forward and eyes glancing around sensually, or leaning on a barn with hands in pockets, like sculptures propping it up. Being outdoors, they heard whatever was in the air. This is where all gossip is first roughly digested before being passed on to finer, more delicate sources indoors. I noticed the village centers were the grocery, bar, post office, and bank; and as part of the necessary setup, they had a bell, cannon, and fire engine in handy spots. The houses were arranged to make the most of the people, in lanes facing each other, so every traveler had to run the gauntlet and everyone could get a chance at him. Of course, those positioned closest to the front, where they could see and be seen the most, paid the highest prices for their spots; and the few scattered residents on the outskirts, where there were gaps in the line and the traveler could hop fences or take side paths to escape, paid very little in taxes. Signs hung on all sides to tempt him; some by appetite, like the tavern and food cellar; some by desire, like the clothing store and jeweler; and others by vanity, like the barber, cobbler, or tailor. Plus, there was an even more formidable standing invite to visit each of these places, with company expected around then. I mostly escaped these dangers, either by marching straight to my goal without hesitation, as is advised for those running the gauntlet, or by keeping my mind on higher things, like Orpheus, who "loudly sang the gods' praises to his lyre, drowning out the Sirens' voices and staying out of danger." Sometimes I darted away suddenly, and no one knew where I went, as I didn't care much about gracefulness and never paused at a gap in a fence. I even used to burst into some houses, where I was well received, and after learning the core and latest bits of news, what had settled down, the odds of war and peace, and if the world would likely hold together much longer, I was let out the back way, and so fled back to the woods again.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire “as I sailed.  I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home thus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not been able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear of the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue, and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night, close by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning, by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the mean while, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins. I have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying is. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way, feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they turned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow storm, even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that he has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in it, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By night, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most trivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or turned round,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost,—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of Nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as often as he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">It was very enjoyable, when I stayed late in the city, to venture into the night, especially if it was dark and stormy. I would set off from some cozy living room or lecture hall, with a bag of rye or cornmeal on my shoulder, heading for my snug hideaway in the forest. I would make everything secure outside and retreat inside with a cheerful group of thoughts, leaving only my physical self at the wheel, or even tying up the wheel when the sailing was straightforward. The woods are darker than most people think, even on typical nights. I often had to look up at the gap between the trees above the trail to figure out my path. Where there was no road, I would feel the faint track I had made with my feet, or navigate by the familiar placement of certain trees that I sensed with my hands. Sometimes, after returning home late on a dark, humid night, when my feet could feel the path my eyes couldn't see, I would be so lost in thought that I couldn't remember a single step of my journey until I had to raise my hand to lift the latch. Several times, when a guest happened to stay into the evening and it turned out to be a dark night, I had to lead them to the path behind the house and point out the direction they should go. One very dark night, I guided two young men who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile away through the woods and knew the route well. But a day or two later, one of them told me they had wandered around most of the night, close to their own property, and didn't get home until nearly morning. By then, there had been several heavy rain showers, so the leaves were very wet and they were soaked to the skin. Getting lost in the woods at any time is a surprising, memorable, and valuable experience. Often in a snowstorm, even during the day, you can end up on a familiar road but find it impossible to tell which way leads to town. You may have traveled it a thousand times, but you won't recognize any of its features - it will seem as foreign as a road in Siberia. At night, of course, the confusion is infinitely greater. In our most routine walks, we are constantly, though subconsciously, navigating like pilots using well-known landmarks. If we go beyond our usual route, we still keep in mind the location of some nearby reference point. Only when we are totally lost, or turned around - for a person only needs to be spun around once with their eyes closed in this world to be lost - do we grasp the immensity and unfamiliarity of nature. Everyone has to relearn the cardinal directions each time they wake up, whether from sleep or any distraction. Only when we are lost - in other words, only when we have lost the world - do we start to find ourselves and understand where we are and the boundless scope of our connections.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">One afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the village to get a shoe from the cobbler’s, I was seized and put into jail, because, as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or recognize the authority of, the state which buys and sells men, women, and children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house. I had gone down to the woods for other purposes. But, wherever a man goes, men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society. It is true, I might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect, might have run “amok  against society; but I preferred that society should run “amok  against me, it being the desperate party. However, I was released the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and returned to the woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair-Haven Hill. I was never molested by any person but those who represented the state. I had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers, not even a nail to put over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door night or day, though I was to be absent several days; not even when the next fall I spent a fortnight in the woods of Maine. And yet my house was more respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers. The tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire, the literary amuse himself with the few books on my table, or the curious, by opening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what prospect I had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came this way to the pond, I suffered no serious inconvenience from these sources, and I never missed anything but one small book, a volume of Homer, which perhaps was improperly gilded, and this I trust a soldier of our camp has found by this time. I am convinced, that if all men were to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be unknown. These take place only in communities where some have got more than is sufficient while others have not enough. The Pope’s Homers would soon get properly distributed.—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">One day in late summer, I went to town to pick up a repaired shoe from the cobbler. To my surprise, I was arrested and jailed for not paying a tax or acknowledging the authority of a state that trades people like livestock. I had other reasons for going to the woods, but it seems that wherever you go, people will hound you with their corrupt institutions and try to force you into their desperate society. I could have resisted, even violently, but I chose to let society attack me instead, since they were the desperate ones. Luckily, I was freed the next day, got my fixed shoe, and made it back to the woods in time for a huckleberry lunch on Fair-Haven Hill. I was only ever bothered by government officials. I didn't even have a lock, bolt, or nail to secure my desk, door or windows. I never locked up, even when gone for days, like during a two-week trip to the Maine woods. Still, people respected my house more than if it had been guarded by soldiers. Tired wanderers could rest by my fire, the studious could read my few books, and the nosy could check my closet to see what was left of my meals. Though many different folks came by the pond, I had no real problems and only ever lost one small book - an over-decorated Homer that some soldier probably found. I believe that if everyone lived as simply as I did then, theft and robbery would not exist. Those only happen in places where some have excess and others too little. The Pope's fancy books would quickly find their rightful homes.</p>
