Once or twice, however, while I lived at the pond, I found myself ranging the woods, like a half-starved hound, with a strange abandonment, seeking some kind of venison which I might devour, and no morsel could have been too savage for me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably familiar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a higher, or, as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another toward a primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I love the wild not less than the good. The wildness and adventure that are in fishing still recommended it to me. I like sometimes to take rank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do. Perhaps I have owed to this employment and to hunting, when quite young, my closest acquaintance with Nature. They early introduce us to and detain us in scenery with which otherwise, at that age, we should have little acquaintance. Fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others, spending their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of Nature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing her, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers or poets even, who approach her with expectation. She is not afraid to exhibit herself to them. The traveller on the prairie is naturally a hunter, on the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia a trapper, and at the Falls of St. Mary a fisherman. He who is only a traveller learns things at second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most interested when science reports what those men already know practically or instinctively, for that alone is a true <i>humanity</i>, or account of human experience.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-a transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001"> As I walked home through the forest with my fish on a line, dragging my rod in the dark, I spotted a groundhog crossing my trail. I felt a wild thrill and the urge to grab and eat him raw—not from hunger, but for the wildness he stood for. While living by the pond, I sometimes found myself roaming the woods half-starved, with a strange recklessness, craving some kind of deer meat to consume. No piece would have been too untamed for me. The most rugged scenes became oddly familiar. I've discovered, and continue to recognize, two competing urges within myself. One pulls me towards a more elevated or so-called spiritual existence, which I believe most people experience. The other draws me towards a basic, primal way of living. I respect both of these instincts equally. I love the untamed as much as the civilized. Fishing's wildness and adventure still appeal to me. I enjoy sometimes living my day more like the creatures do. Perhaps I owe my closest connection with nature to fishing and hunting from a young age. They introduce us early on to landscapes we'd otherwise barely know then. Fishermen, hunters, lumberjacks, and others who spend their days outdoors, in a unique way a part of nature, are frequently in a better state of mind to observe her in the breaks between their activities than even philosophers or poets who come to her with expectations. She doesn't mind showing herself to them. The wayfarer on the grassland is inherently a hunter, near the Missouri and Columbia rivers' sources a trapper, and at St. Mary's Falls an angler. The mere traveler gains knowledge secondhand and incompletely, and is an unreliable source. We're most intrigued when science confirms what such men already grasp practically or instinctively, as only that is genuine humanity, or a true record of human experience. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">They mistake who assert that the Yankee has few amusements, because he has not so many public holidays, and men and boys do not play so many games as they do in England, for here the more primitive but solitary amusements of hunting fishing and the like have not yet given place to the former. Almost every New England boy among my contemporaries shouldered a fowling piece between the ages of ten and fourteen; and his hunting and fishing grounds were not limited, like the preserves of an English nobleman, but were more boundless even than those of a savage. No wonder, then, that he did not oftener stay to play on the common. But already a change is taking place, owing, not to an increased humanity, but to an increased scarcity of game, for perhaps the hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting the Humane Society.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"> Those who claim that Americans have few amusements are mistaken, because even though there are not as many public holidays or games played as in England, more basic solo activities like hunting and fishing are still common here. Nearly all New England boys from my generation owned a shotgun between the ages of ten and fourteen, and their hunting and fishing areas were vast, even more expansive than those of a Native American. It's no surprise then that these boys rarely stayed to play in town. However, this is starting to change, not due to growing compassion, but because game is becoming more scarce. Ironically, the hunter may be the greatest ally of the hunted animals, even more so than animal welfare organizations. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">Moreover, when at the pond, I wished sometimes to add fish to my fare for variety. I have actually fished from the same kind of necessity that the first fishers did. Whatever humanity I might conjure up against it was all factitious, and concerned my philosophy more than my feelings. I speak of fishing only now, for I had long felt differently about fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods. Not that I am less humane than others, but I did not perceive that my feelings were much affected. I did not pity the fishes nor the worms. This was habit. As for fowling, during the last years that I carried a gun my excuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought only new or rare birds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is a finer way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer attention to the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I have been willing to omit the gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on the score of humanity, I am compelled to doubt if equally valuable sports are ever substituted for these; and when some of my friends have asked me anxiously about their boys, whether they should let them hunt, I have answered, yes,—remembering that it was one of the best parts of my education,—<i>make</i> them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if possible, mighty hunters at last, so that they shall not find game large enough for them in this or any vegetable wilderness,—hunters as well as fishers of men. Thus far I am of the opinion of Chaucer’s nun, who</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003"> Furthermore, when I was at the pond, I occasionally wanted to add fish to my diet for variety. I have fished out of the same necessity as the earliest fishermen. Any humanity I could summon against it was artificial and more about my philosophy than my emotions. I'm only talking about fishing now, as I had felt differently about hunting birds for a long time and sold my gun before going into the woods. It's not that I'm less humane than others, but I didn't feel that my emotions were significantly impacted. I didn't feel sorry for the fish or the worms. It was just a habit. When it comes to hunting birds, in recent years when I carried a gun, my excuse was that I was studying birds and only sought new or rare species. However, I now tend to think there is a better way to study birds than this. It demands much closer attention to their habits, and for that reason alone, I have been willing to give up using a gun. Yet despite the objection on the grounds of humanity, I have to question whether equally valuable activities can truly replace these. When some friends have asked me anxiously about their sons and whether they should let them hunt, I have said yes—remembering that it was one of the best parts of my own upbringing. Make them hunters, even if only sportsmen at first, but if possible, mighty hunters in the end, so that they won't find any game large enough for them in this or any other wilderness. Make them hunters as well as fishers of men. In this, I agree with Chaucer's nun, who </p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">There is a period in the history of the individual, as of the race, when the hunters are the “best men,  as the Algonquins called them. We cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more humane, while his education has been sadly neglected. This was my answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit, trusting that they would soon outgrow it. No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which holds its life by the same tenure that he does. The hare in its extremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my sympathies do not always make the usual phil-<i>anthropic</i> distinctions.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006"> There is a time in a person's life, just as in the history of humanity, when hunters are considered the "best men," as Native Americans called them. One can't help but feel sorry for a boy who has never shot a gun; his education has been sadly lacking, even if he is no more humane for it. This was my response to those young men who were determined to hunt, hoping they would soon mature past it. No compassionate person, beyond the reckless age of youth, will needlessly kill any creature that lives by the same rules he does. A hare, when in a desperate situation, cries like a child. I caution you, mothers, that my sympathies do not always align with typical humanitarian distinctions. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">Such is oftenest the young man’s introduction to the forest, and the most original part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher, until at last, if he has the seeds of a better life in him, he distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be, and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and always young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no uncommon sight. Such a one might make a good shepherd’s dog, but is far from being the Good Shepherd. I have been surprised to consider that the only obvious employment, except wood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the like business, which ever to my knowledge detained at Walden Pond for a whole half day any of my fellow-citizens, whether fathers or children of the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly they did not think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless they got a long string of fish, though they had the opportunity of seeing the pond all the while. They might go there a thousand times before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their purpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on all the while. The governor and his council faintly remember the pond, for they went a-fishing there when they were boys; but now they are too old and dignified to go a-fishing, and so they know it no more forever. Yet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the legislature regards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be used there; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to angle for the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus, even in civilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of development.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007"> This is often how a young man first experiences the forest, connecting with his most authentic self. Initially he goes as a hunter and fisherman, but if he has the potential for a richer life, he eventually recognizes his true calling, perhaps as a poet or naturalist, and abandons his gun and fishing pole. Most men remain forever young in this regard. In some places, a hunting clergyman is a common sight. He might make a good sheepdog, but is far from being a true shepherd. I was amazed to realize that fishing was the only apparent activity, besides tasks like chopping wood or cutting ice, that ever kept any of my fellow townspeople, young or old, at Walden Pond for an entire half-day, with just one exception. Usually they felt their time was wasted unless they caught many fish, even though they could admire the pond the whole time. They could visit a thousand times before the residue of fishing settled and their intentions became clear, but no doubt this refining process was always underway. The governor and his advisors dimly recall the pond from their boyhood fishing trips, but now they are too old and respectable to fish, so it is lost to them forever. Yet even they hope to reach heaven in the end. If the government pays any attention, it is mainly to control the number of fishing hooks used there; but they are ignorant of the supreme hook for catching the pond itself, using the government as bait. Thus, even in advanced societies, the budding human passes through the hunting phase of development. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">I have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without falling a little in self-respect. I have tried it again and again. I have skill at it, and, like many of my fellows, a certain instinct for it, which revives from time to time, but always when I have done I feel that it would have been better if I had not fished. I think that I do not mistake. It is a faint intimation, yet so are the first streaks of morning. There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of creation; yet with every year I am less a fisherman, though without more humanity or even wisdom; at present I am no fisherman at all. But I see that if I were to live in a wilderness I should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest. Beside, there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh, and I began to see where housework commences, and whence the endeavor, which costs so much, to wear a tidy and respectable appearance each day, to keep the house sweet and free from all ill odors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak from an unusually complete experience. The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and, besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I had rarely for many years used animal food, or tea, or coffee, &amp;c.; not so much because of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as because they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind. It is a significant fact, stated by entomologists, I find it in Kirby and Spence, that “some insects in their perfect state, though furnished with organs of feeding, make no use of them;  and they lay it down as “a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat much less than in that of larvæ. The voracious caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly,  . . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly,  content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet liquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents the larva. This is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate. The gross feeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations in that condition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose vast abdomens betray them.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008"> I've realized in recent years that fishing makes me feel less self-respect. I've tried it repeatedly, and while I have the skill and instinct for it that occasionally revives, I always feel afterwards that it would have been better if I hadn't fished. I believe I'm not mistaken in this. It's a faint feeling, but so are the first light streaks of dawn. This instinct undoubtedly belongs to lower creatures, and each year I become less of a fisherman, though not necessarily wiser or more humane. Currently, I'm not a fisherman at all. However, I see that living in the wilderness would again tempt me to seriously fish and hunt. Besides, there's something inherently unclean about eating meat and flesh. I began to understand where housekeeping starts, and the great effort to maintain a neat, respectable daily appearance and keep the home pleasant and free of bad smells and sights. Having been my own butcher, dishwasher, and cook, as well as the gentleman being served, I speak from an unusually comprehensive experience. For me, the practical issue with animal food was its uncleanliness. Moreover, after catching, cleaning, cooking and eating fish, they didn't seem to truly nourish me. It was trivial, unnecessary, and cost more than it was worth. Some bread or potatoes would have sufficed, with less hassle and mess. Like many of my peers, I had seldom eaten animal products, tea, coffee, etc. for many years, not due to any negative effects I noticed, but because they didn't appeal to my imagination. The aversion to animal food is instinctive, not based on experience. In many ways, it seemed more attractive to live simply and frugally, and though I never fully did so, I went far enough to satisfy my imagination. I believe any man serious about preserving his higher, poetic faculties in the best state has been especially inclined to avoid animal food and excessive food in general. Entomologists, like Kirby and Spence, note the significant fact that “some insects in their perfect state, though furnished with organs of feeding, make no use of them; and they establish  “a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat much less than in that of larvæ. The voracious caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly, . . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly,  content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet liquid.The abdomen under a butterfly's wings still represents the larva. This is the delicacy that lures its insectivorous fate. The heavy eater is a man in the larval stage, and entire nations exist in that state, nations lacking imagination, whose large bellies give them away. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">It is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed the body; they should both sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this may be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of our appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra condiment into your dish, and it will poison you. It is not worth the while to live by rich cookery. Most men would feel shame if caught preparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner, whether of animal or vegetable food, as is every day prepared for them by others. Yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized, and, if gentlemen and ladies, are not true men and women. This certainly suggests what change is to be made. It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be reconciled to flesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a miserable way,—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits, or slaughtering lambs, may learn,—and he will be regarded as a benefactor of his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent and wholesome diet. Whatever my own practice may be, I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009"> It's difficult to offer and prepare a diet so simple and pure that it won't upset the imagination; but I believe this should be considered when we nourish the body; they should both be seated at the same table. Yet maybe this is possible. Fruits eaten in moderation don't need to make us embarrassed by our appetites or disrupt the most worthwhile activities. But add an extra seasoning to your plate, and it will make you sick. It's not worthwhile to live on rich food. Most people would feel ashamed if caught making the exact same meal with their own hands, whether meat or vegetables, that others prepare for them daily. But until this changes, we aren't civilized, and if we're gentlemen and ladies, we aren't real men and women. This definitely hints at the change that must occur. It may be futile to question why the imagination won't accept meat and fat. I'm convinced that it won't. Isn't it a criticism that humans are carnivorous creatures? It's true that he can and largely does survive by hunting other animals, but this is a wretched way to live—as anyone who tries trapping rabbits or killing lambs will discover—and the person who teaches humans to limit themselves to a more harmless and healthy diet will be seen as a benefactor to the species. Regardless of my own habits, I'm certain that it's part of humanity's fate, as we gradually progress, to stop consuming animals, just as primitive tribes stopped eating each other when they encountered more advanced societies. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">If one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius, which are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even insanity, it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute and faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs of mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,—that is your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010"> If you listen to the subtle yet persistent guidance of your inner voice, which is undoubtedly true, you'll see that it can lead you to extremes or even madness. But as you become more determined and loyal, that's the path you must take. The slightest genuine doubt felt by one sound-minded person will eventually triumph over the opinions and traditions of the masses. No one has ever pursued their true calling without being misled at times. Even if it leads to physical frailty, perhaps no one can claim the results weren't worth it, as it means living by higher standards. If you welcome each day and night with delight, and your life radiates the aroma of blossoms and fragrant herbs—more vibrant, celestial, and eternal—that is a true achievement. All of nature joins in celebrating you, and you have reason to feel blessed in each moment. The most significant rewards and treasures are the hardest to recognize and appreciate. We quickly start to question their existence and forget about them. Yet they embody the ultimate truth. The most astonishing and genuine realities may never be shared from one person to another. The authentic yield of my everyday existence is as intangible and indescribable as the hues of dawn or dusk—a bit of stardust captured, a fragment of the rainbow I've seized. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">Yet, for my part, I was never unusually squeamish; I could sometimes eat a fried rat with a good relish, if it were necessary. I am glad to have drunk water so long, for the same reason that I prefer the natural sky to an opium-eater’s heaven. I would fain keep sober always; and there are infinite degrees of drunkenness. I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of dashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an evening with a dish of tea! Ah, how low I fall when I am tempted by them! Even music may be intoxicating. Such apparently slight causes destroyed Greece and Rome, and will destroy England and America. Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes? I have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse labors long continued, that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely also. But to tell the truth, I find myself at present somewhat less particular in these respects. I carry less religion to the table, ask no blessing; not because I am wiser than I was, but, I am obliged to confess, because, however much it is to be regretted, with years I have grown more coarse and indifferent. Perhaps these questions are entertained only in youth, as most believe of poetry. My practice is “nowhere,  my opinion is here. Nevertheless I am far from regarding myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the Ved refers when it says, that “he who has true faith in the Omnipresent Supreme Being may eat all that exists,  that is, is not bound to inquire what is his food, or who prepares it; and even in their case it is to be observed, as a Hindoo commentator has remarked, that the Vedant limits this privilege to “the time of distress. </p>

I'm glad to have drunk water for so long, for the same reason I prefer the real sky to an opium-eater's heaven. I'd rather stay sober always; there are endless levels of drunkenness. I believe water is the only wise drink; wine is less noble. And imagine ruining a morning with coffee, or an evening with tea! How low I sink when tempted by them! Even music can be intoxicating. Such seemingly small things destroyed Greece and Rome, and they will destroy England and America. Of all intoxication, who doesn't prefer to be intoxicated by the air they breathe? I've found the most serious problem with long, hard labor is that it also makes me eat and drink crudely. But honestly, I find myself less picky about these things now. I bring less spirituality to the table, don't say grace; not because I'm wiser, but, I must admit, because over the years I've become coarser and more apathetic. Maybe these issues only matter in youth, as most think of poetry. My habits are "nowhere," my views are here. Still, I'm far from seeing myself as one of those special people the Vedas mention when saying "he who truly believes in the Omnipresent Supreme Being may eat all that exists"—meaning they needn't ask what their food is, or who makes it. And even then, as a Hindu commentator noted, the Vedanta limits this privilege to "times of distress". </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">Who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in which appetite had no share? I have been thrilled to think that I owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I have been inspired through the palate, that some berries which I had eaten on a hill-side had fed my genius. “The soul not being mistress of herself,  says Thseng-tseu, “one looks, and one does not see; one listens, and one does not hear; one eats, and one does not know the savor of food.  He who distinguishes the true savor of his food can never be a glutton; he who does not cannot be otherwise. A puritan may go to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an alderman to his turtle. Not that food which entereth into the mouth defileth a man, but the appetite with which it is eaten. It is neither the quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or inspire our spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us. If the hunter has a taste for mud-turtles, muskrats, and other such savage tid-bits, the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf’s foot, or for sardines from over the sea, and they are even. He goes to the mill-pond, she to her preserve-pot. The wonder is how they, how you and I, can live this slimy, beastly life, eating and drinking.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012"> Who hasn't sometimes gotten an incredible joy from their meal that had nothing to do with hunger? I've been amazed to realize that I owed a mental insight to the usually basic sense of taste, that I've been moved through the tongue, that some fruits I had eaten on a hillside had nourished my creativity. “The soul not being mistress of herself,  says Tseng-tzu, “one looks, and one does not see; one listens, and one does not hear; one eats, and one does not know the savor of food.  The person who recognizes the true taste of their food can never overeat; the one who doesn't, can't avoid it. A puritan may approach their brown bread with the same crude hunger as an alderman does his turtle soup. It's not the food that goes into the mouth that corrupts someone, but the craving with which it's consumed. It's not the quality or amount, but the obsession with sensual flavors; when what's eaten isn't sustenance for our body or inspiration for our spirit, but just food for the parasites inside us. If the hunter has a liking for mud turtles, muskrats, and other such unrefined morsels, the elegant woman indulges a preference for calf's foot jelly or imported sardines, and they're the same. He goes to the pond, she to her jam jar. The wonder is how they, how you and I, can live this squalid, animalistic life of consumption. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant’s truce between virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never fails. In the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on this which thrills us. The harp is the travelling patterer for the Universe’s Insurance Company, recommending its laws, and our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay. Though the youth at last grows indifferent, the laws of the universe are not indifferent, but are forever on the side of the most sensitive. Listen to every zephyr for some reproof, for it is surely there, and he is unfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a string or move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us. Many an irksome noise, go a long way off, is heard as music, a proud sweet satire on the meanness of our lives.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013"> Our entire existence is remarkably ethical. There is never a moment's pause between goodness and wrongdoing. Virtue is the only investment that always pays off. In the music of the harp that echoes around the world, it is the emphasis on this that moves us. The harp is the wandering advocate for the Universe's Insurance Company, endorsing its rules, and our small acts of kindness are the only premium we contribute. Although young people eventually become apathetic, the laws of the universe are not indifferent, but always favor the most conscientious. Listen to every breeze for some criticism, as it is certainly present, and unfortunate is the one who fails to hear it. We cannot pluck a string or press a key without the delightful lesson piercing us. Many a bothersome sound, from a distance, is perceived as music, a lofty sweet mockery of the pettiness of our lives. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">We are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher nature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled; like the worms which, even in life and health, occupy our bodies. Possibly we may withdraw from it, but never change its nature. I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own; that we may be well, yet not pure. The other day I picked up the lower jaw of a hog, with white and sound teeth and tusks, which suggested that there was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual. This creature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity. “That in which men differ from brute beasts,  says Mencius, “is a thing very inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men preserve it carefully.  Who knows what sort of life would result if we had attained to purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me purity I would go to seek him forthwith. “A command over our passions, and over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.  Yet the spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and function of the body, and transmute what in form is the grossest sensuality into purity and devotion. The generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes us unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the flowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of purity is open. By turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts us down. He is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in him day by day, and the divine being established. Perhaps there is none but has cause for shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature to which he is allied. I fear that we are such gods or demigods only as fauns and satyrs, the divine allied to beasts, the creatures of appetite, and that, to some extent, our very life is our disgrace.—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014"> We are aware of an animalistic side within us that grows stronger as our higher nature weakens. This primal part is reptilian and sensual, and perhaps can never be completely removed, like the worms that live inside our bodies even when we are healthy. We may distance ourselves from it, but its nature remains unchanged. I worry that this side may have a certain vitality of its own; that we can be well, but not truly pure. Recently, I found the lower jaw of a pig with healthy white teeth and tusks, which suggested an animal strength separate from the spirit. This creature thrived through means other than moderation and purity. “That in which men differ from brute beasts,  says Mencius, “is a thing very inconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men preserve it carefully.  Who knows what kind of existence would emerge if we achieved purity? If I knew a wise teacher of purity, I would seek them out immediately. “A command over our passions, and over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.  Yet the spirit can temporarily permeate and command every part and function of the body, transforming even the crudest sensuality into purity and devotion. The creative force, which when unrestrained spreads and defiles us, invigorates and uplifts us when we practice self-control. Chastity is the blossoming of humanity, and qualities like Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and others are the fruits that follow. When the path of purity is clear, we flow directly to God. Our purity alternately inspires us and our impurity brings us down. Blessed are those who know the animal within is dying day by day as the divine takes root. Perhaps everyone has reason to feel ashamed of the inferior, beastly nature to which they are connected. I fear we may be divine only in the way of fauns and satyrs—godlike beings tied to animals, creatures of desire—and that to some degree, our very existence is our disgrace. </p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">All sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one. It is the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is. The impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If you would be chaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall a man know if he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have heard of this virtue, but we know not what it is. We speak conformably to the rumor which we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth ignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit of mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits by a stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being fatigued. If you would avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work earnestly, though it be at cleaning a stable. Nature is hard to be overcome, but she must be overcome. What avails it that you are Christian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself no more, if you are not more religious? I know of many systems of religion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shame, and provoke him to new endeavors, though it be to the performance of rites merely.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023"> All sensuality is the same, even if it appears in different ways; all purity is also one. Whether a person eats, drinks, has sex, or sleeps in a sensual manner, it's all the same appetite. Seeing someone do any of these things reveals how sensual they are. The impure cannot exist with purity. When a snake is threatened at one end of its hole, it emerges from the other. To be chaste, one must be moderate. But what is chastity? How can a person know if they are chaste? They cannot know for certain. We have heard of this virtue but don't truly understand it. We merely repeat the rumors we've heard. Wisdom and purity come from effort; ignorance and sensuality from laziness. In a student, sensuality is a sluggish state of mind. An unclean person is always a lazy one who sits idly, basking in the sun without exerting themselves. To avoid impurity and sin, work diligently even if the task is humble. Human nature is difficult to conquer but it must be overcome. What good is being Christian if you are no purer than a non-believer, if you don't deny yourself any more than they do, if you are no more devout? I know of many religions considered pagan whose teachings fill the reader with shame and inspire them to improve themselves, even if only through rituals. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0024">I hesitate to say these things, but it is not because of the subject,—I care not how obscene my <i>words</i> are,—but because I cannot speak of them without betraying my impurity. We discourse freely without shame of one form of sensuality, and are silent about another. We are so degraded that we cannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature. In earlier ages, in some countries, every function was reverently spoken of and regulated by law. Nothing was too trivial for the Hindoo lawgiver, however offensive it may be to modern taste. He teaches how to eat, drink, cohabit, void excrement and urine, and the like, elevating what is mean, and does not falsely excuse himself by calling these things trifles. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0024"> I'm reluctant to discuss these matters, not because of the topic itself—I don't mind how crude my language is—but because I can't talk about them without exposing my own impurity. We openly chat about one kind of indulgence without any embarrassment, yet stay quiet about another. We've sunk so low that we're unable to plainly speak of the essential functions of human nature. In past eras and some cultures, every bodily function was discussed with reverence and controlled by customs. Nothing was too frivolous for the Hindu lawmakers, no matter how distasteful it might seem to modern sensibilities. They provided guidance on eating, drinking, sex, defecation, urination, and similar acts, elevating what is considered base. They didn't falsely excuse themselves by dismissing these things as unimportant details. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0025">Every man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he worships, after a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering marble instead. We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to refine a man’s features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0025"> Each person constructs a temple, their body, to the deity they revere, in their own unique way. One cannot avoid this by working with marble instead. We are all artists, and our medium is our flesh, blood, and bones.

Having bathed, he sat down to re-create his intellectual man. It was a rather cool evening, and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one playing on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he thought of his work; but the burden of his thought was, that though this kept running in his head, and he found himself planning and contriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little. It was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled off. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street, and the village, and the state in which he lived. A voice said to him,—Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over other fields than these.—But how to come out of this condition and actually migrate thither? All that he could think of was to practise some new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem it, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.</p>

It was no more than the flakes of his skin, which were constantly shed. But the flute notes reached his ears from a different realm than the one in which he toiled and hinted at a purpose for certain abilities that lay dormant within him.
