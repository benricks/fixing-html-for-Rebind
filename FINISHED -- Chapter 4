Much is published, but little printed. The rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed. No method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a course of history, or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the best society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a reader, a student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before you, and walk on into futurity.</p>

Much is shared, but little is truly absorbed. The light streaming through the window will be forgotten when the shutters are fully opened. No process or training can replace the need to be constantly attentive. What good is studying history, philosophy, poetry, even the best-curated, or keeping ideal company and routines, compared to the practice of always observing what's in front of you? Will you merely consume information, or will you truly see? Anticipate your path, look ahead, and step forward into the future.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller’s wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours went. The day advanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished. Instead of singing like the birds, I silently smiled at my incessant good fortune. As the sparrow had its trill, sitting on the hickory before my door, so had I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear out of my nest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that “for yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one word, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for to-morrow, and overhead for the passing day.  This was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the birds and flowers had tried me by their standard, I should not have been found wanting. A man must find his occasions in himself, it is true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove his indolence.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">That first summer, I didn't read books; I cultivated beans. Often, I did even better. There were moments when I couldn't bear to sacrifice the present for any work, physical or mental. I love having plenty of free time. Some summer mornings, after my usual bath, I'd sit in my sunny doorway from sunrise to noon, lost in thought, surrounded by pines, hickories, and sumacs, in perfect peace and quiet. Birds would sing nearby or flit silently through the house. Only when the sun fell through my west window, or a traveler's wagon sounded on the distant road, was I reminded of passing time. In those seasons, I grew like corn overnight, and it was much better than working. It wasn't time taken from my life, but a bonus beyond my usual share. I understood the Eastern idea of contemplation and letting go of tasks. Mostly, I didn't mind how the hours passed. The day went on as if to illuminate my work; morning came, then evening, with nothing notable done. Rather than singing like birds, I quietly smiled at my constant good luck. Like the sparrow trilling on the hickory by my door, I had my own chuckle or muffled song that it might hear from my nest. My days weren't marked by the week or any pagan god, nor chopped into hours and vexed by a ticking clock. I lived like the Puri Indians, who have just one word for yesterday, today, and tomorrow, conveying different meanings by pointing backward, overhead, or forward. To my neighbors, this was pure laziness, no doubt. But if birds and flowers had judged me, I wouldn't have fallen short. True, one must find purpose within. The natural day is very serene and will hardly condemn his idleness.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many scenes and without an end. If we were always indeed getting our living, and regulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui. Follow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour. Housework was a pleasant pastime. When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the villagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move in again, and my meditations were almost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see my whole household effects out on the grass, making a little pile like a gypsy’s pack, and my three-legged table, from which I did not remove the books and pen and ink, standing amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad to get out themselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was worth the while to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free wind blow on them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in the house. A bird sits on the next bough, life-everlasting grows under the table, and blackberry vines run round its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and strawberry leaves are strewn about. It looked as if this was the way these forms came to be transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and bedsteads,—because they once stood in their midst.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">My lifestyle had at least one advantage over those who had to seek entertainment from society and the theater: my life itself became my amusement and never stopped being new. It was an endless drama with many scenes. If we always made a living and lived according to the latest and greatest methods we learned, we'd never be bored. Follow your passion closely, and it will always show you something fresh. Housework was a fun hobby. When my floor got dirty, I got up early, put all my furniture outside on the grass, with the bed and frame in one bundle, splashed water on the floor, sprinkled white sand from the pond, and scrubbed it clean and white with a broom. By the time the villagers finished breakfast, the morning sun had dried my house enough for me to move back in, barely interrupting my thoughts. It was nice to see all my belongings out on the grass, like a little gypsy's pack, with my three-legged table still holding my books, pen and ink, standing among the pines and hickories. They seemed happy to be out and reluctant to come back in. I was sometimes tempted to put up an awning and sit out there. It was worth seeing the sun shine on these things and feeling the wind blow on them freely; familiar objects are much more interesting outdoors than inside. A bird perches on a nearby branch, everlasting flowers grow under the table, and blackberry vines wrap around the legs; pine cones, chestnuts, and strawberry leaves are scattered about. It seemed this was how these shapes ended up on our furniture—tables, chairs, and beds—because they once stood among them.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">My house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the larger wood, in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen rods from the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub-oaks and sand-cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the sand-cherry (<i>Cerasus pumila</i>,)
        adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with good sized and handsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I tasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The sumach (<i>Rhus glabra</i>,) grew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the embankment which I had made, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical leaf was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the large masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">My home sat on a hillside, right next to a large forest, surrounded by young pine and hickory trees. A narrow path wound down the hill to a pond just a stone's throw away. My front yard was filled with strawberries, blackberries, everlasting flowers, St John's wort, goldenrod, shrub oaks, sand cherries, blueberries and groundnuts. In late May, the sand cherry bushes lining the path were adorned with delicate blossoms arranged in cylindrical clusters on their short stems. By fall, those stems were weighed down with plump, pretty cherries, draped in wreaths on all sides. I sampled them as a nod to nature, though they weren't very tasty. Sumac grew vigorously around the house, sprouting up through the raised bed I had built, shooting up five or six feet in the first year. I enjoyed gazing at its large, unusual, fern-like leaves. The hefty buds, bursting out suddenly in late spring from dry twigs that had looked lifeless, magically unfurled into graceful, supple, inch-thick branches. Sometimes, while sitting at my window, I'd hear a fresh, delicate branch, carelessly overtaxed by its own weight, suddenly snap and drop to the ground like a fan, even when there wasn't a hint of a breeze. In August, the sizable clusters of berries, which had drawn many wild bees when in bloom, slowly ripened to a vivid velvety crimson, their weight once more pulling down and breaking the fragile branches.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">As I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about my clearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes athwart my view, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind my house, gives a voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy surface of the pond and brings up a fish; a mink steals out of the marsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is bending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and thither; and for the last half hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars, now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge, conveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so out of the world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in the east part of the town, but ere long ran away and came home again, quite down at the heel and homesick. He had never seen such a dull and out-of-the-way place; the folks were all gone off; why, you couldn’t even hear the whistle! I doubt if there is such a place in Massachusetts now:—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">As I sit by my window this summer afternoon, hawks circle above my clearing. The galloping of wild pigeons, flying in pairs and trios across my view or restlessly perching on the white pine branches behind my house, gives voice to the air. A fish hawk ripples the glassy pond surface and catches a fish. A mink sneaks out of the marsh in front of my door and grabs a frog by the shore. The sedge bends under the weight of reed-birds darting back and forth. For the past half hour, I've heard the clatter of train cars, fading away and then returning like the drumming of a partridge, carrying passengers from Boston to the countryside.I did not live as isolated from the world as that boy who, I hear, was sent to live with a farmer in the east part of town, but soon ran away homesick. He had never seen such a boring and remote place; everyone was gone, and you couldn't even hear a whistle! I doubt there is such a place in Massachusetts anymore.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">The Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of where I dwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am, as it were, related to society by this link. The men on the freight trains, who go over the whole length of the road, bow to me as to an old acquaintance, they pass me so often, and apparently they take me for an employee; and so I am. I too would fain be a track-repairer somewhere in the orbit of the earth.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">The Fitchburg Railroad passes near the pond about 400 yards south of my home. I often walk to town along its path, connected to the community by this route. The workers on the cargo trains, traveling the full distance, wave to me like an old friend since they see me so frequently. They must think I work for the railroad too, and in a sense, I do. I would also gladly be a track maintenance worker somewhere on this earth.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">The whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter, sounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer’s yard, informing me that many restless city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town, or adventurous country traders from the other side. As they come under one horizon, they shout their warning to get off the track to the other, heard sometimes through the circles of two towns. Here come your groceries, country; your rations, countrymen! Nor is there any man so independent on his farm that he can say them nay. And here’s your pay for them! screams the countryman’s whistle; timber like long battering rams going twenty miles an hour against the city’s walls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavy laden that dwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility the country hands a chair to the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are stripped, all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city. Up comes the cotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk, down goes the woollen; up come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">The train whistle echoes through my forest in all seasons, resembling a hawk's cry over a farmer's land. It signals the arrival of many anxious city merchants and daring rural traders. As they approach from one direction, they warn those on the other side of the tracks, their calls heard across two towns. Here comes your food supply, villagers! No farmer is so self-sufficient that he can refuse them. And here's your payment! the rural whistle screams. Timber races toward the city walls like battering rams, and chairs to seat all the exhausted and burdened city dwellers. The countryside offers a seat to the city with immense and awkward politeness. All the Indian blueberry hills are bare, all the cranberry bogs are harvested for the city. Cotton arrives, woven cloth departs; silk comes, wool goes; books appear, but the cleverness that creates them fades.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">When I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary motion,—or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with that velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system, since its orbit does not look like a returning curve,—with its steam cloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths, like many a downy cloud which I have seen, high in the heavens, unfolding its masses to the light,—as if this travelling demigod, this cloud-compeller, would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of his train; when I hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils, (what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology I don’t know), it seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as it seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud that hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as beneficent as that which floats over the farmer’s fields, then the elements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and be their escort.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">When I see the train engine pulling its cars with planetary motion—or more like a comet, since the observer doesn't know if it will ever return on this path, as its route doesn't seem like a loop—with its steam cloud trailing behind like a banner of gold and silver ribbons, similar to many a fluffy cloud I've seen high in the sky, spreading out in the light—as if this traveling demigod, this commander of clouds, would soon adorn the sunset sky with its magnificent train; when I hear the iron horse make the hills ring with its thunderous snort, shaking the ground beneath its feet, and breathing fire and smoke from its nostrils (I wonder what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they'll include in the new mythology), it feels like the earth finally has a race worthy of living on it. If only everything was as it appeared, and people used the elements as their servants for noble purposes! If the clouds hanging over the engine were the result of heroic acts, or as helpful as the one floating over the farmer's fields, then the elements and Nature herself would gladly join and guide people on their journeys.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">I watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do the rising of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of clouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher, going to heaven while the cars are going to Boston, conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant field into the shade, a celestial train beside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear. The stabler of the iron horse was up early this winter morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened thus early to put the vital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as innocent as it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes, and with the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the seaboard, in which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies over the country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall only with the morning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or slumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off the superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool his liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise were as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied!</p>

The train of clouds stretching far behind the cars and rising higher into the sky, heading to heaven while the cars go to Boston, briefly hides the sun and casts my distant field into shade. This celestial train makes the small train of cars hugging the earth seem like just the tip of a spear in comparison. The keeper of the iron horse rose early this winter morning, under the starlight in the mountains, to feed and prepare his steed. Fire was also awakened early to warm the horse and get him going. If only the endeavor was as innocent as it is early! When the snow is deep, they strap snow-shoes on the horse and use a giant plow to clear a path from the mountains to the sea. The train cars then follow behind like a seed drill, spreading all the restless people and goods across the land. All day, the sun flies over the country, only stopping to let his master rest. I'm awakened by his tramping and bold snorting at midnight, when he faces the icy, snowy elements in some remote forest glen. He'll only reach his stable by the morning star, only to set out again on his ceaseless journey. Or perhaps in the evening, I hear him in his stable, releasing the extra energy from the day, so he can calm his nerves and cool his body and mind for a few hours of deep sleep. If only the enterprise was as heroic and impressive as it is long and tireless!</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">Far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once only the hunter penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these bright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment stopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city, where a social crowd is gathered, the next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl and fox. The startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in the village day. They go and come with such regularity and precision, and their whistle can be heard so far, that the farmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution regulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than they did in the stage-office? There is something electrifying in the atmosphere of the former place. I have been astonished at the miracles it has wrought; that some of my neighbors, who, I should have prophesied, once for all, would never get to Boston by so prompt a conveyance, are on hand when the bell rings. To do things “railroad fashion  is now the by-word; and it is worth the while to be warned so often and so sincerely by any power to get off its track. There is no stopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of the mob, in this case. We have constructed a fate, an <i>Atropos</i>, that never turns aside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised that at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular points of the compass; yet it interferes with no man’s business, and the children go to school on the other track. We live the steadier for it. We are all educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of invisible bolts. Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on your own track, then.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013">In the darkest night, these bright saloons dart through remote woods on the outskirts of towns, where only hunters once ventured by day. One moment they stop at a lively station in a city, where a crowd has gathered, and the next they're in the Dismal Swamp, frightening owls and foxes. The comings and goings of the trains now mark the key moments in the village day. They run with such consistency and accuracy, their whistles heard from afar, that farmers use them to set their clocks. A single well-run institution thus regulates an entire region. Haven't people become more punctual since the invention of the railroad? Don't they talk and think more quickly at the station than they did at the stagecoach office? The atmosphere there is electrifying. I've been amazed by the wonders it has achieved; some of my neighbors, who I would have bet would never make it to Boston by such a fast means, are present when the bell sounds. Doing things "railroad fashion" is now the catchphrase, and it's worthwhile to be so frequently and earnestly warned by any power to avoid its path. There's no pausing to read the riot act, no shooting over the heads of the mob in this case. We've created a destiny, an Atropos, that never veers off course. (Let that be the name of your engine.) People are notified that at a specific hour and minute, these bolts will be fired towards particular directions. Yet it doesn't interfere with anyone's affairs, and children still go to school on the other track. It makes our lives more stable. We're all raised to be like William Tell's sons.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does not clasp its hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go about their business with more or less courage and content, doing more even than they suspect, and perchance better employed than they could have consciously devised. I am less affected by their heroism who stood up for half an hour in the front line at Buena Vista, than by the steady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snow-plough for their winter quarters; who have not merely the three-o’-clock in the morning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the rarest, but whose courage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only when the storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this morning of the Great Snow, perchance, which is still raging and chilling men’s blood, I hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from out the fog bank of their chilled breath, which announces that the cars <i>are coming</i>, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto of a New England north-east snow storm, and I behold the ploughmen covered with snow and rime, their heads peering, above the mould-board which is turning down other than daisies and the nests of field-mice, like bowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that occupy an outside place in the universe.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014">I admire the bravery and enterprise of commerce. These men go about their work every day with courage and contentment, often accomplishing more than they realize. Their steady valor is more impressive to me than the brief heroism of soldiers in battle. The men who operate snow-plows in winter, working tirelessly through storms until their machines freeze, possess a rare and enduring courage. On this morning of the Great Snow, I hear the muffled bell of their engine through the fog of their chilled breath, signaling the arrival of the train despite the raging blizzard. I see the plowmen covered in snow and frost, their heads peeking above the plow as it turns up earth, standing out in the universe like boulders in the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">Commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and unwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than many fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments, and hence its singular success. I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks, the old junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of torn sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets which need no correction. Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet, risen four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split up; pine, spruce, cedar,—first, second, third, and fourth qualities, so lately all of one quality, to wave over the bear, and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which will get far among the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of all hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen descend, the final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer cried up, unless it be in Milwaukie, as those splendid articles, English, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, &amp;c., gathered from all quarters both of fashion and poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few shades only, on which forsooth will be written tales of real life, high and low, and founded on fact! This closed car smells of salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me of the Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this world, so that nothing can spoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which you may sweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster shelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind it,—and the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a sign when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and boiled, will come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner. Next Spanish hides, with the tails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careering over the pampas of the Spanish main,—a type of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all constitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned a man’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better or worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and after a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural form.  The only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is usually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of molasses or of brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the Green Mountains, who imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance stands over his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast, how they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment, as he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects some by the next train of prime quality. It is advertised in the Cuttingsville Times.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">Commerce is surprisingly confident and calm, watchful, bold, and tireless. Its methods are very natural, much more so than many wild ventures and emotional experiments, which explains its remarkable success. I feel refreshed and uplifted when the cargo train rumbles by, and I catch the scent of goods traveling from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, evoking distant lands, coral reefs, Indian oceans, tropical climates, and the vastness of the world. I feel more like a global citizen seeing the palm leaves that will cover so many blond New England heads next summer, the Manila hemp and coconut husks, the old junk, burlap sacks, scrap metal, and rusty nails. This load of ripped sails is more readable and intriguing now than if made into paper and printed books. Who can write the history of the storms they weathered as vividly as these tears have? They are proofs needing no editing. Here goes timber from the Maine forests, which stayed put in the last flood, now up four dollars per thousand due to what washed away or got split; pine, spruce, cedar—first, second, third, and fourth grades, so recently all one quality—tower over the bear, moose, and caribou. Next comes Thomaston lime, a top batch, which will travel far into the hills before slaking. These rags in bales, of all colors and types, the lowest state cotton and linen can reach, the end result of clothing—of styles no longer popular, unless in Milwaukee, as those grand items—English, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, etc.—collected from all corners of fashion and poverty, are set to become paper of one color or a few shades only, on which, indeed, will be written true stories, high and low, based on fact! This sealed car reeks of salt fish, the potent New England and business smell, reminding me of the Grand Banks and fisheries. Who hasn't seen a salt fish, fully preserved for this world, so nothing can ruin it, putting the saints' perseverance to shame? You can sweep or pave streets with it, split kindling, and the driver can use it to shield himself and his load from sun, wind and rain—and the merchant, as a Concord trader once did, can hang it by his door as a sign when he starts business, until finally his oldest customer can't say if it's animal, vegetable, or mineral, yet it will be as pure as a snowflake, and if put in a pot and boiled, will make a fine dun fish for a Saturday dinner. Next, Spanish hides, with the tails still curled at the angle they had when the oxen wearing them roamed the pampas of the Spanish main—a symbol of all stubbornness, showing how nearly hopeless and incurable all inborn vices are. I admit, in practical terms, once I've learned a man's true nature, I have no hope of improving or worsening it in this life. As the people of the East say, “A cur’s tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and after a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural form.  <span class="calibre1">The only lasting cure for such deeply rooted traits as these tails display is to glue  them, which I believe is the usual end for them, and then they'll stay put and stick. Here's a barrel of molasses or brandy addressed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some merchant in the Green Mountains, who imports for farmers near his clearing, and now perhaps stands over his counter pondering the latest shipments on the coast, how they might change his price, telling his patrons this minute, as he's said twenty times already this morning, that he awaits some top quality goods on the next train. It's posted in the Cuttingsville Times.</span></p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0030">Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it. There came to me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and therein is the magic and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in the bell, but partly the voice of the wood; the same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0030">On Sundays, I sometimes heard the distant bells from Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord when the wind was right. The sound was a faint, sweet, natural melody that seemed to belong in the wilderness. From far away over the woods, the sound took on a vibrating hum, as if the pine needles on the horizon were harp strings being played. All sounds heard from a great distance have the same effect—a vibration of the universal lyre. Just as the air between us makes a distant ridge of earth appealing to our eyes with its blue color. The melody that reached me had been strained by the air and had spoken with every leaf and needle of the forest. It was the part of the sound that the elements had captured, changed, and echoed from valley to valley. The echo is, to some degree, an original sound, and that's where its magic and charm lie. It's not just a repeat of the best parts of the bell, but also the voice of the woods. The same simple words and notes are sung by a forest nymph.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0031">At evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods sounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for the voices of certain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who might be straying over hill and dale; but soon I was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of the cow. I do not mean to be satirical, but to express my appreciation of those youths’ singing, when I state that I perceived clearly that it was akin to the music of the cow, and they were at length one articulation of Nature.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0031">In the evening, the far-off mooing of a cow beyond the forest sounded pleasant and tuneful. At first, I thought it was the singing of some wandering musicians who occasionally serenaded me. But I was soon pleasantly surprised when the sound turned into the simple, natural song of the cow. I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but rather express my enjoyment of those young people's singing. I realized it was clearly related to the cow's music, and they were both ultimately a single expression of Nature.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0032">Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the evening train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of the house. They would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock, within five minutes of a particular time, referred to the setting of the sun, every evening. I had a rare opportunity to become acquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four or five at once in different parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind another, and so near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each note, but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web, only proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably I was near its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and were again as musical as ever just before and about dawn. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0032">Every summer evening at 7:30, right after the evening train passed, the whippoorwills would sing their evening songs for thirty minutes. They perched on a stump by my door or on the roof ridge of the house. The birds started singing with almost clock-like precision, within five minutes of the same time each night, based on when the sun set. I had a unique chance to learn about their behavior. At times, I heard four or five whippoorwills in different parts of the woods, accidentally singing one note behind the other. They were so close I could hear not just the cluck after each note, but also a strange buzzing noise that sounded like a fly caught in a spider's web, only much louder. One would occasionally fly in circles around me in the woods a few feet away, as if tied to me by a string, likely when I was close to its eggs. The whippoorwills sang on and off all night and were just as melodic near dawn.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0033">When other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain, like mourning women their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben Jonsonian. Wise midnight hags! It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who of the poets, but, without jesting, a most solemn graveyard ditty, the mutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and the delights of supernal love in the infernal groves. Yet I love to hear their wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along the wood-side; reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds; as if it were the dark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that would fain be sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy forebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the earth and did the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with their wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their transgressions. They give me a new sense of the variety and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling. <i>Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks. Then—<i>that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> echoes another on the farther side with tremulous sincerity, and—<i>bor-r-r-r-n!</i> comes faintly from far in the Lincoln woods.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0033">When other birds are quiet, the screech owls begin their song, sounding like grieving women with their ancient lament. Their gloomy cry is truly melancholic. Wise midnight witches! It's not the honest and direct hooting of the poets, but rather a most solemn graveyard tune, the shared solace of tragic lovers recalling the agonies and joys of heavenly love in the hellish groves. Yet I adore hearing their cries, their mournful calls, echoing through the woods; sometimes reminding me of music and songbirds, as if it were the dark and sorrowful aspect of melody, the regrets and sighs yearning to be sung. They are the spirits, the depressed souls and sad omens, of fallen beings that once roamed the earth in human form, committing acts of darkness, now atoning for their wrongdoings with their wailing songs in the very places of their transgressions. They give me a fresh appreciation for the diversity and potential of the natural world we all inhabit. Oh, how I wish I had never been born! laments one from this side of the pond, restlessly circling to a new roost in the gray oaks. Then another echoes the same sentiment with quivering sincerity from the opposite shore, and the refrain faintly reaches from deep in the Lincoln woods.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0034">I was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it the most melancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to stereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human being,—some poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind, and howls like an animal, yet with human sobs, on entering the dark valley, made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness,—I find myself beginning with the letters gl when I try to imitate it,—expressive of a mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in the mortification of all healthy and courageous thought. It reminded me of ghouls and idiots and insane howlings. But now one answers from far woods in a strain made really melodious by distance,—<i>Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer hoo</i>; and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing associations, whether heard by day or night, summer or winter.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0034">I was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Up close, you could imagine it as the saddest sound in Nature, as if she wanted to make the dying moans of a person a permanent part of her choir—some poor, weak remnant of humanity who has abandoned hope, and cries out like an animal, yet with human sobs, upon entering the dark valley. The sound was made even more dreadful by a certain gurgling melody. I find myself starting with the letters "gl" when I try to mimic it, conveying a mind that has reached the slimy, decaying stage in the death of all healthy and brave thought. It brought to mind ghouls, idiots, and mad howls. But then, an owl answers from the distant forest in a tune made truly melodic by the distance, Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer hoo. In fact, most of the time, the owl's call evoked only pleasant associations, whether heard during the day or night, summer or winter.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0035">I rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for men. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day illustrates, suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized. They represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have. All day the sun has shone on the surface of some savage swamp, where the single spruce stands hung with usnea lichens, and small hawks circulate above, and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens, and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath; but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns, and a different race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature there.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0035">I'm glad owls exist. Let them hoot crazily for humans. It's a sound perfect for swamps and dark woods that daylight never reaches, hinting at a huge, unknown natural world people haven't discovered. Owls embody the eerie dusk and restless thoughts we all experience. The sun shines all day on wild marshes, where lone pines are draped with moss, small hawks fly overhead, chickadees chirp in the pines, and grouse and rabbits hide below. But as a gloomier, more fitting day breaks, different creatures stir to convey the swamp's true essence.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0036">Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over bridges,—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night,—the baying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn-yard. In the mean while all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake,—if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there are almost no weeds, there are frogs there,—who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to distend their paunches, and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most aldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water, and passes round the cup with the ejaculation <i>tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and when this observance has made the circuit of the shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, <i>tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended, leakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake; and then the bowl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing <i>troonk</i> from time to time, and pausing for a reply. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0036">Late at night, I heard the distant rumble of wagons crossing bridges—a sound that carries farther than most in the darkness. Dogs barked and sometimes a lonely cow mooed in a far-off barn. Meanwhile, the shore echoed with the calls of bullfrogs, those hardy spirits of old drinkers and revelers, still unrepentant in their dark lake. Though the pond has few weeds, it has plenty of frogs, who try to keep up the rowdy traditions of their old feasts, even as their voices grow hoarse and grave. They mock merriment as the wine loses its taste, becoming mere liquid to bloat their bellies. Sweet intoxication no longer drowns the past; only saturation, waterlogging, and swelling remain. The fattest frog, with his chin on a lily pad that serves as a bib for his drooling jowls, gulps down the once-scorned water. He passes the cup with a croak that echoes from distant coves as the next biggest frog drinks his fill. When this ritual circles the shore, the master of ceremonies croaks with satisfaction, and each frog follows suit down to the smallest and most shriveled. The bowl goes around again and again until the rising sun disperses the morning mist. In the end, only the patriarch is not submerged, still croaking in vain and waiting for a reply.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0037">I am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing, and I thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music merely, as a singing bird. The note of this once wild Indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any bird’s, and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated, it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the owl; and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the pauses when their lords’ clarions rested! No wonder that man added this bird to his tame stock,—to say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter morning in a wood where these birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the wild cockerels crow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the resounding earth, drowning the feebler notes of other birds,—think of it! It would put nations on the alert. Who would not be early to rise, and rise earlier and earlier every successive day of his life, till he became unspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird’s note is celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native songsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more indigenous even than the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs are sound, his spirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and Pacific is awakened by his voice; but its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers. I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither the churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor even the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn, nor children crying, to comfort one. An old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui before this. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or rather were never baited in,—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the window, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in the night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those mild plantation birds, ever visited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard. No yard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to your very sills. A young forest growing up under your meadows, and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale,—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no front-yard,—and no path to the civilized world!</p>

The call of this once wild pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any bird, and if they could be introduced to the wild without being tamed, it would quickly become the most famous sound in our forests, surpassing the honking of geese and the hooting of owls. And then imagine the cackling of hens filling the pauses when their mates' trumpets rested! It's no wonder that man added this bird to his domestic animals, not to mention the eggs and drumsticks. To walk on a winter morning in a forest where these birds were plentiful, their native woods, and hear the wild roosters crowing in the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the echoing earth, drowning out the weaker songs of other birds—just imagine it! It would put nations on high alert. Who wouldn't rise early, and earlier each day of his life, until he became incredibly healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird's call is celebrated by poets of all lands along with the songs of their native birds. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more native than the natives. His health is always good, his lungs are strong, and his spirits never wane. Even sailors on the Atlantic and Pacific are awakened by his voice, but its shrill sound never woke me from my sleep. I kept no dog, cat, cow, pig, or chickens, so you might say there was a lack of homey sounds—no churning, spinning wheel, singing kettle, hissing urn, or crying children to comfort one. An old-fashioned man would have lost his mind or died of boredom. Not even rats in the walls, as they were starved out, or rather never lured in—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a whippoorwill on the ridgepole, a blue jay screaming under the window, a rabbit or woodchuck under the house, a screech owl or a horned owl behind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox barking at night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those gentle plantation birds, ever visited my clearing. No roosters to crow or hens to cackle in the yard. No yard at all, but untamed nature reaching right up to your windowsills. A young forest sprouting up in your fields, wild sumac and blackberry vines invading your cellar; sturdy pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for lack of space, their roots reaching under the house. Instead of a hatch or shutter blown off in a storm, a pine tree snapped off or uprooted behind your house for firewood. Instead of no path to the front gate in the deep snow—no gate, no front yard, and no path to civilization!</p>
