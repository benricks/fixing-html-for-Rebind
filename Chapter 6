I am naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit out the sturdiest frequenter of the bar-room, if my business called me thither.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-i transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001"> believe I enjoy being around people as much as anyone, and I'm quite willing to attach myself temporarily to any lively person I encounter.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the third chair for them all, but they generally economized the room by standing up. It is surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain. I have had twenty-five or thirty souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof, and yet we often parted without being aware that we had come very near to one another. Many of our houses, both public and private, with their almost innumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the storage of wines and other munitions of peace, appear to me extravagantly large for their inhabitants. They are so vast and magnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them. I am surprised when the herald blows his summons before some Tremont or Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over the piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into some hole in the pavement.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"> I had three chairs in my home; one for being alone, two for companionship, and three for entertaining guests. When more visitors showed up than expected, they all had to share the third chair, but they usually made it work by standing. It's amazing how many people a small house can hold. I've had twenty-five or thirty people, bodies and all, under my roof at once, yet we often left without realizing how close we had been. Many of our buildings, both public and private, with their nearly endless rooms, massive halls, and basements for storing wine and other peaceful supplies, seem far too big for the people living in them. They're so huge and grand that the residents appear to be nothing more than pests infesting them. When the announcer calls out in front of some fancy hotel, I'm surprised to see a tiny mouse creep out onto the porch as the sole occupant before quickly scurrying back into a crack in the sidewalk. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">One inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the difficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plough out again through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could not begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other’s undulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other’s breath; but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above, being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case. Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not room enough.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003"> One drawback I occasionally faced in such a tiny house was the challenge of getting far enough away from my guest when we started expressing profound ideas using grand language. You need space for your thoughts to get into sailing form and run a lap or two before reaching their destination. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its sideways and ricocheting motion and settled into its final steady path before hitting the listener's ear, or it might plow back out through the side of their head. Our sentences also required room to unfold and arrange themselves. People, like countries, need appropriate wide and natural borders, even a sizable neutral zone, between them. I've found it a unique pleasure to converse across the pond with a friend on the far side. In my home, we were so close that we couldn't even begin to hear each other—we couldn't talk softly enough to be heard; like when you toss two rocks into still water so near that they disrupt each other's ripples. If we're just chatty and noisy, then we can stand very close, cheek to cheek, and feel each other's breath; but if we speak cautiously and reflectively, we need to be further apart, so all body heat and moisture can dissipate. If we wish to enjoy the deepest connection with the part of each of us that is beyond words, we must not only be quiet but be so physically distant that we can't possibly hear each other's voice under any circumstances. By this measure, talking is for the benefit of those who are hard of hearing; but there are many beautiful things we can't say if we have to yell. As the discussion started to take on a more elevated and majestic tone, we gradually pushed our chairs further apart until they hit the walls in opposite corners, and then often there still wasn't enough space. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">My “best  room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for company, on whose carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my house. Thither in summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took them, and a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and kept the things in order.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004"> My “favorite  room, though, my retreat always prepared for visitors, was the evergreen forest behind my home where the sun rarely shone on its floor. There on warm days, when special guests arrived, I brought them, and an invaluable housekeeper cleaned the ground, wiped the furnishings, and tidied up. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">If one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no interruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or watching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in the mean while. But if twenty came and sat in my house there was nothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two, more than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence against hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and decay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed miraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its ground. I could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any ever went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home, they may depend upon it that I sympathized with them at least. So easy is it, though many housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and better customs in the place of the old. You need not rest your reputation on the dinners you give. For my own part, I was never so effectually deterred from frequenting a man’s house, by any kind of Cerberus whatever, as by the parade one made about dining me, which I took to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so again. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to have for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my visitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005"> If a single guest visited, he would sometimes share my simple meal. Conversation flowed easily, even while I stirred a quick pudding or watched bread rise and bake in the ashes. But if twenty people came and sat in my home, nothing was said about dinner, even if there was only enough bread for two. It was as if eating was a forgotten habit. We naturally practiced restraint, and this was never seen as a lack of hospitality, but the most fitting and thoughtful approach. The deterioration of the body, which so often needs restoration, seemed miraculously slowed in such cases, and vitality held its ground. I could host a thousand as easily as twenty. If anyone left my house disappointed or hungry when I was home, they can be sure I empathized with them. Many hosts doubt it, but it's so simple to create new and better traditions to replace the old. Your reputation need not depend on the meals you serve. I was never so effectively discouraged from visiting someone's home by any kind of guard dog as by the fuss made about having me for dinner. I took it as a very polite and indirect hint to never trouble them again. I don't think I'll ever return to those places. I'd be honored to have as the slogan for my humble abode the words of Spenser that one of my guests wrote on a yellow walnut leaf as a calling card:– </p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a companion on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the woods, and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well received by the king, but nothing was said about eating that day. When the night arrived, to quote their own words,—“He laid us on the bed with himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it being only planks laid a foot from the ground, and a thin mat upon them. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and upon us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey.  At one o’clock the next day Massasoit “brought two fishes that he had shot,  about thrice as big as a bream; “these being boiled, there were at least forty looked for a share in them. The most ate of them. This meal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of us bought a partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.  Fearing that they would be light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to “the savages’ barbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves asleep,)  and that they might get home while they had strength to travel, they departed. As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor; but as far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could have done better. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to their guests; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about it. Another time when Winslow visited them, it being a season of plenty with them, there was no deficiency in this respect.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010"> When Winslow, later the governor of Plymouth Colony, visited Massasoit with a friend, they walked through the woods and arrived tired and hungry at his home. The king welcomed them, but didn't mention food that day. At night, in their own words, "He put us on the bed with him and his wife, they at one end and we at the other, on planks a foot off the ground with a thin mat. Two more of his important men squeezed in with us due to lack of space, so we were more exhausted from our sleeping arrangements than the trip". The next afternoon, Massasoit "brought two fish he had caught," about three times the size of a bream. "When boiled, at least forty wanted a portion. Most ate some. This was our only meal in two nights and a day, and if one of us hadn't bought a partridge, we would have left hungry". They worried that they would feel faint from lack of food and sleep, because of "the natives' wild singing (they sang themselves to sleep)," and wanting to get home while they could still travel, they left. The lodging was indeed poor, though likely meant as an honor, but for food, I don't see how the Indians could have done more. They had nothing for themselves and knew apologies couldn't replace feeding their guests, so they tightened their belts and said nothing. Another time Winslow visited in a season of abundance, there was plenty. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">As for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors while I lived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean that I had some. I met several there under more favorable circumstances than I could any where else. But fewer came to see me on trivial business. In this respect, my company was winnowed by my mere distance from town. I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude, into which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited around me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored and uncultivated continents on the other side.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011"> Men are easy to find almost anywhere. I had more visitors while living in the woods than at any other time in my life; at least some came by. The circumstances were more favorable for meeting people there than anywhere else. But fewer visited me for trivial reasons. In this way, my distance from town filtered out my company. I had retreated so deeply into the vast ocean of solitude, where society's rivers flow, that mostly only the best bits settled near me. Plus, I sensed signs of whole unexplored, untouched lands on the other side. </p>

He, too, has heard of Homer, and, “if it were not for books,  would “not know what to do rainy days,  though perhaps he has not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons.

He has a great bundle of white-oak bark under his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. “I suppose there’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,  says he. To him Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did not know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to have hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old, and had left Canada and his father’s house a dozen years before to work in the States, and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in his native country. He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house,—for he chopped all summer,—in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as Yankees exhibit. He wasn’t a-going to hurt himself. He didn’t care if he only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes, when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house where he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether he could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall,—loving to dwell long upon these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning, “How thick the pigeons are! If working every day were not my trade, I could get all the meat I should want by hunting,—pigeons, woodchucks, rabbits, partridges,—by gosh! I could get all I should want for a week in one day. </p>

To him, Homer was a great writer, though he didn't know what his writing was about. You'd be hard-pressed to find a simpler and more natural man. Vice and disease, which cast such a dark moral shadow over the world, seemed to barely exist for him. He was about twenty-eight years old and had left Canada and his father's house twelve years ago to work in the States and save money to eventually buy a farm, maybe back in his home country. He was built tough but sluggish, yet carried himself gracefully, with a thick, tanned neck, dark bushy hair, and dull, sleepy blue eyes that occasionally lit up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored coat, and cowhide boots.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0018">He was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his art. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the sprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the stumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood, he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter which you could break off with your hand at last.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0018"> He was a skilled woodcutter and added some flair and style to his work. He cut his trees flush and low to the ground so that the shoots that grew back later would be stronger and a sled could glide over the stumps. Rather than leaving a full tree to hold up his stacked firewood, he would whittle it down to a thin post or sliver that you could snap off by hand in the end. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0019">He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes. His mirth was without alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in the woods, felling trees, and he would greet me with a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation in Canadian French, though he spoke English as well. When I approached him he would suspend his work, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine which he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a ball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him. Looking round upon the trees he would exclaim,—“By George! I can enjoy myself well enough here chopping; I want no better sport.  Sometimes, when at leisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket pistol, firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a kettle; and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in his fingers; and he said that he “liked to have the little <i>fellers</i> about him.  </p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0020">In him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and contentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if he was not sometimes tired at night, after working all day; and he answered, with a sincere and serious look, “Gorrappit, I never was tired in my life.  But the intellectual and what is called spiritual man in him were slumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only in that innocent and ineffectual way in which the Catholic priests teach the aborigines, by which the pupil is never educated to the degree of consciousness, but only to the degree of trust and reverence, and a child is not made a man, but kept a child. When Nature made him, she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion, and propped him on every side with reverence and reliance, that he might live out his threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him, more than if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor. He had got to find him out as you did. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for work, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged opinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble—if he can be called humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct quality in him, nor could he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If you told him that such a one was coming, he did as if he thought that any thing so grand would expect nothing of himself, but take all the responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never heard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and the preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I wrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the handwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely written in the snow by the highway, with the proper French accent, and knew that he had passed. I asked him if he ever wished to write his thoughts. He said that he had read and written letters for those who could not, but he never tried to write thoughts,—no, he could not, he could not tell what to put first, it would kill him, and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time!</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0020"> The animal nature was most developed in him. In physical stamina and satisfaction, he was like the pine and the rock. I once asked if he ever felt tired at night after a full day's work, and he replied sincerely, "Dang it, I've never been tired in my life". But his intellectual and spiritual sides were dormant, like in a baby. He had only been taught in the naive, ineffective manner of Catholic priests with native people, never reaching true awareness, only trust and respect. He was kept a child, not made into a man. Nature gave him a strong body and contentment, supporting him with reverence and reliance to live his seventy years as a child. He was so authentic and simple that no introduction could properly present him, like trying to introduce a woodchuck to your neighbor. You had to figure him out yourself. He wouldn't pretend to be anything else. People paid him for his labor, helping feed and clothe him, but he never shared his thoughts with them. He was so naturally humble, if you can call it humility when one never aims higher, that modesty wasn't a distinct trait in him; he couldn't even imagine it. Wiser men were like gods to him. If you mentioned someone important coming, he acted as if anything that grand would handle everything itself and let him be forgotten. He never heard praise. He especially revered writers and preachers, seeing their work as miraculous. When I said I wrote a good amount, he thought for a while that I just meant penmanship, as his own handwriting was remarkably good. I sometimes saw his hometown's name written beautifully in the snow by the road, with the right French accents, and knew he had passed by. I asked if he ever wanted to write down his thoughts. He said he had read and written letters for those who couldn't, but never tried to write his ideas—no, he couldn't, he wouldn't know what to put first, it would overwhelm him, plus he'd have to think about spelling at the same time! </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0021">I heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did not want the world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of surprise in his Canadian accent, not knowing that the question had ever been entertained before, “No, I like it well enough.  It would have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I sometimes saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of stupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through the village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to himself, he reminded him of a prince in disguise.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0021"> I heard that a renowned wise man and reformer asked him if he wanted the world to change, but he responded with a surprised laugh in his Canadian accent, unaware that the question had ever been considered before, "No, I'm quite content with it." Dealing with him would have prompted many thoughts for a philosopher. To an outsider, he seemed to know little about things in general, yet at times I glimpsed a man I hadn't seen before. I was unsure if he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply naive as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic awareness or of foolishness. A local mentioned that when he encountered him strolling through the village in his small, snug cap, whistling to himself, he was reminded of a prince in disguise. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0022">His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was considerably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopædia to him, which he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before. Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he dispense with tea and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do without money, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of the word <i>pecunia</i>. If an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other. At another time, hearing Plato’s definition of a man,—a biped without feathers,—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato’s man, he thought it an important difference that the <i>knees</i> bent the wrong way. He would sometimes exclaim, “How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!  I asked him once, when I had not seen him for many months, if he had got a new idea this summer. “Good Lord,  said he, “a man that has to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he has had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined to race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds.  He would sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any improvement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied with himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest without, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!  said he; “some men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man, perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!  Yet I never, by any manœuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this, practically, is true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his mode of life, he merely answered, without expressing any regret, that it was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like virtues.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0022"> His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic book, in which he was quite skilled. The almanac was like an encyclopedia to him, which he believed contained a summary of human knowledge, as it does to a significant degree. I enjoyed asking his opinion on the various reforms of the day, and he always viewed them in the simplest and most practical way. He had never heard of such things before. I asked if he could manage without factories. He said he had worn the homemade Vermont gray cloth, and that was good enough. Could he get by without tea and coffee? Did this country have any drink besides water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, thinking it was better than plain water in warm weather. When I asked if he could do without money, he explained the usefulness of money in a way that aligned with the most philosophical accounts of how this system began, and the origin of the word "pecunia". If an ox was his property, and he wanted to get needles and thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient and soon impossible to keep mortgaging part of the animal each time for that amount. He could justify many institutions better than any philosopher because in describing them as they affected him, he gave the real reason for their existence, and speculation had not made him consider any other.

He would sometimes ask me first on such occasions if I had made any improvements myself. One winter day, I asked if he was always satisfied with himself, wanting to suggest an inner substitute for the external priest, and a higher reason for living. "Satisfied!" he said, "some men are satisfied with one thing, some with another. One man, maybe, if he has enough, will be content to sit all day with his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!" Yet I could never, by any maneuvering, get him to take a spiritual view of things; the highest he seemed to imagine was simple expediency, like you'd expect an animal to appreciate; and this, in practice, is true of most people. If I proposed any improvement to his way of life, he simply replied, without expressing any regret, that it was too late. Still, he completely believed in honesty and similar virtues. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">There was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be detected in him, and I occasionally observed that he was thinking for himself and expressing his own opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I would any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it amounted to the re-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always had a presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so primitive and immersed in his animal life, that, though more promising than a merely learned man’s, it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported. He suggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of life, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take their own view always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless even as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and muddy.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023"> There was a certain unique quality about him, even if it was subtle. I sometimes noticed that he was thinking independently and voicing his own views, something so uncommon that I would gladly travel a long way just to see it. It was like he was reinventing many of society's norms. Although he sometimes struggled to express himself clearly, there was always a worthwhile idea behind his words. But his thinking was so basic and tied to his physical existence that, while more promising than a purely academic man's thoughts, it seldom developed into anything worth reporting. He proposed that there may be brilliant people in even the lowest rungs of society, forever lowly and uneducated, who always see things their own way or don't claim to see at all,  who are as deep as Walden Pond was once believed to be, even if they seem obscure and confused. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0024">Many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my house, and, as an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I told them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to lend them a dipper. Far off as I lived, I was not exempted from the annual visitation which occurs, methinks, about the first of April, when every body is on the move; and I had my share of good luck, though there were some curious specimens among my visitors. Half-witted men from the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to make them exercise all the wit they had, and make their confessions to me; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and so was compensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the so called <i>overseers</i> of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought it was time that the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned that there was not much difference between the half and the whole. One day, in particular, an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper, whom with others I had often seen used as fencing stuff, standing or sitting on a bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying, visited me, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He told me, with the utmost simplicity and truth, quite superior, or rather <i>inferior</i>, to any thing that is called humility, that he was “deficient in intellect.  These were his words. The Lord had made him so, yet he supposed the Lord cared as much for him as for another. “I have always been so,  said he, “from my childhood; I never had much mind; I was not like other children; I am weak in the head. It was the Lord’s will, I suppose.  And there he was to prove the truth of his words. He was a metaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellow-man on such promising ground,—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that he said. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself was he exalted. I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise policy. It seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the poor weak-headed pauper had laid, our intercourse might go forward to something better than the intercourse of sages. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0024"> Many travelers went out of their way to visit me and see the inside of my house. As an excuse to stop by, they would ask for a glass of water. I told them I drank from the pond and offered to lend them a cup. Even though I lived far away, I wasn't exempt from the yearly rush of visitors that happens around the first of April when everyone is out and about. I had my share of interesting characters among the visitors. Men from the poorhouse and other places came to see me, but I tried to engage their minds and have them open up to me. In those cases, I made wit the focus of our talks, which made it worthwhile. In fact, I found some of them wiser than the so-called overseers of the poor and town officials. When it came to wit, there wasn't much difference between the simple and the sophisticated. One day, a harmless, simple-minded pauper visited me. He was often used as a human fence post in fields to keep cattle from wandering off. He told me, with complete honesty and lack of pretense, that he was "lacking in intellect". Those were his exact words. He believed God had made him that way, but that God cared for him just as much as anyone else. "I've always been like this," he said, "ever since I was a child. I never had much of a mind. I was different from other children. I'm weak in the head. It was God's will, I guess." And there he was, proving his own words true. He was a philosophical puzzle to me. I had rarely met a man on such promising ground—he was so simple, sincere, and honest in everything he said. And, true enough, the more he humbled himself, the more he was lifted up. At first, I wasn't sure if it was a result of some wise strategy. It seemed that starting from such a foundation of truth and openness, as this poor feeble-minded pauper had, our interaction could lead to something better than even the discourse of wise men. </p>

I require of a visitor that he be not actually starving, though he may have the very best appetite in the world, however he got it. Objects of charity are not guests. Men who did not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about my business again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men of almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season.

Girls and boys and young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods. They looked in the pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of the great distance at which I dwelt from something or other; and though they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was obvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was all taken up in getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject, who could not bear all kinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers, uneasy housekeepers who pried into my cupboard and bed when I was out,—how came Mrs.—— to know that my sheets were not as clean as hers?—young men who had ceased to be young, and had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the professions,—all these generally said that it was not possible to do so much good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and the timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden accident and death; to them life seemed full of danger,—what danger is there if you don’t think of any?—and they thought that a prudent man would carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be on hand at a moment’s warning. To them the village was literally a <i>com-munity</i>, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that they would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount of it is, if a man is alive, there is always <i>danger</i> that he may die, though the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is dead-and-alive to begin with. A man sits as many risks as he runs. Finally, there were the self-styled reformers, the greatest bores of all, who thought that I was forever singing,—

Girls, boys, and young women generally seemed happy to be in the forest. They gazed at the pond and flowers, making the most of their time. Businessmen, even farmers, only thought about being alone and working, and how far away I lived from anything else. Though they claimed to enjoy an occasional walk in the woods, it was clear they didn't. Restless, busy men, whose time was consumed with making a living or keeping it; preachers who talked about God as if they had a monopoly on the topic and couldn't tolerate differing views; doctors, lawyers, nosy housekeepers who snooped in my cupboard and bed when I was gone—how did Mrs. ---- know my sheets weren't as clean as hers? Young men who were no longer young and had decided the safest path was to follow the typical careers—they all usually said it wasn't possible to do as much good in my situation. Ah, there was the problem. The elderly, infirm, and timid, regardless of age or gender, worried most about illness, accidents, and death; to them, life seemed very dangerous—but what danger is there if you don't think about it? They believed a wise man would carefully choose the safest place, where Dr. B could be available at a moment's notice. To them, the village was literally a community, a mutual defense alliance, and you'd think they wouldn't go berry-picking without a first-aid kit. The point is, if a man is alive, there's always a chance he may die, though the risk must be lower the more lifeless he is to start with. A man faces as many dangers as he takes on.
