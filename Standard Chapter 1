            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of these questions in this book. In most books, the <i>I</i>, or first person, is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"> I wouldn't bother my readers with my personal matters if my neighbors hadn't asked very specific questions about how I live. Some might call these questions nosy, but given the situation, I find them quite normal and relevant. People have asked what I eat, if I get lonely, if I'm scared, and similar things. Others have wondered how much of my money I give to charity, and those with big families have asked how many poor kids I support. So in this book, I'll try to answer some of these questions for readers who aren't particularly interested in me. Most books leave out the "I" or first-person perspective, but I'll keep it here. That's the main difference in terms of self-focus. We often forget that it's always the first person speaking. I wouldn't talk about myself so much if I knew anyone else as well. Sadly, my limited experience confines me to this topic. Also, I expect every writer to eventually give an honest account of their own life, not just stories of others. It should read like a letter sent to family from a faraway place, because if they've lived authentically, it was indeed far from my own life. Maybe these pages are mostly for poor students. My other readers can take what applies to them. Be careful when you put on this coat, for it may serve you well if it fits. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something about your condition, especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach;  or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.</p>

I want to talk about your situation, especially your external situation or circumstances in this world, in this town—what it's like, whether it has to be as bad as it is, and whether it can be improved. I've traveled quite a bit in Concord, and everywhere—in stores, offices, and fields—the people seemed to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. I've heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and staring at the sun, or hanging upside down over flames, or twisting their necks to look at the sky until they can't move their heads back, and can only drink liquids. I've heard of them chaining themselves to trees for life, or using their bodies to measure the width of vast empires like caterpillars, or standing on one leg on top of pillars. But even these forms of deliberate penance are hardly more unbelievable and shocking than the scenes I see every day. The twelve labors of Hercules were nothing compared to what my neighbors have taken on. His were only twelve tasks and they ended, but I could never see these men slay any monster or finish any labor. They have no friend like Iolas to burn away the hydra's head—as soon as they crush one head, two more pop up. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man’s life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and wood-lot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.</p>

These things are easier to get than to get rid of. It would be better if they were born in an open field and nursed by a wolf, so they could see more clearly what work they were meant to do. Who turned them into slaves of the land? Why should they have to work their sixty acres, when people are destined to only have a small piece of land? Why should they start digging their graves as soon as they're born? They have to live their lives, pushing all these burdens in front of them, and get by as best they can. I've met so many poor souls nearly crushed and suffocated under their loads, crawling down life's road, pushing a seventy-five by forty foot barn, with stables that are never cleaned, and one hundred acres of crops, hay, pasture, and woods! Those without inheritances, who don't have to deal with such unnecessary burdens, already find it hard enough to control and cultivate their own bodies. </p>

By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—</p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011"> Even in this relatively free nation, most people are so preoccupied with trivial worries and needlessly hard work that they can't enjoy life's greatest pleasures. Their hands are too clumsy and shaky from too much labor to do so. The working person doesn't have time for true integrity every day; he can't afford to have the most honorable relationships with others, as it would lower his value at work. He only has time to be a machine. How can he properly acknowledge his lack of knowledge, which is needed for growth, when he must constantly use what he knows? We should occasionally provide for him and lift his spirits before judging him. Our finest qualities, like the softness of fruit, can only be maintained with the gentlest care. Yet we don't treat ourselves or each other with such kindness. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the Latins <i>æs alienum</i>, another’s brass, for some of their coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how little.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012"> Many of you, as we all know, are struggling financially, barely getting by, and sometimes feel like you can't catch your breath. I'm sure some of you reading this are unable to afford all the meals you've eaten or the clothes that are wearing out, and you've come to this page on borrowed or stolen time, taking an hour away from your responsibilities. It's clear that many of you lead difficult and humble lives, as I've seen it all before. You're always on the edge, trying to start a business or get out of debt—an age-old problem the Romans called aes alienum, or another's <i class="calibre3">brass</i>, as some of their coins were made of brass. You live, die, and are buried by this debt, always promising to pay it back tomorrow, but going broke today. You try to gain favor and drum up business  in so many ways, stopping just short of criminal offenses. You lie, flatter, vote, and shrink yourselves into a shell of politeness or expand into a wisp of thin generosity, all to convince your neighbor to let you make their shoes, hat, coat, or carriage, or to deliver their groceries. You make yourselves ill to save up for a rainy day, hiding your meager savings in an old chest, behind the walls, or more securely, in the bank. It doesn't matter where or how much—you just keep struggling to get by. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and imagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013"> I often ponder how we can be so careless, I might even say, as to focus on the obvious but somewhat distant form of bondage known as Negro Slavery, when there are so many sharp and clever masters that enslave both the north and south. It's tough to have a southern master; it's tougher to have a northern one; but toughest of all is when you are your own slave-driver. We speak of divinity in man! Look at the driver on the road, heading to market day or night; does any divinity stir in him? His greatest duty is to feed and water his horses! What does his destiny mean to him compared to shipping interests? How godlike and immortal is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely he fears all day, not being immortal or divine, but a slave and prisoner of his own self-opinion, a reputation earned by his own actions. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared to our own private views. What a man thinks of himself determines, or rather indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation, even in the West Indian realms of imagination—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Consider also the ladies of the land weaving cushions against the last day, not to show too much interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without harming eternity. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014"> Most people live lives of quiet desperation. What seems like acceptance is really just hopelessness that's been accepted. From the hopeless city, you go to the hopeless countryside, and have to take comfort in the courage of small animals. A common but unspoken despair hides even under what people call fun and entertainment. There's no real joy in these things, since they come after the daily grind. But it's a sign of wisdom to avoid doing reckless things out of desperation. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015"> When we think about the main purpose of life and what we truly need, it seems as if people have intentionally chosen the usual way of living because they liked it best. But they genuinely believe they have no other option. However, sharp and vibrant minds recall that the sun came up bright. It's never too late to let go of our biases. No way of thinking or acting, no matter how old, can be accepted without evidence. What everyone repeats or quietly accepts as true today might be exposed as false tomorrow, just smoke and mirrors that some mistook for clouds that would bring nourishing rain. What elders say you can't do, you attempt and discover you can. Old actions for the elderly, new actions for the young. In the past, old folks may not have known enough to keep the fire burning with fresh fuel; young people put a bit of kindling under a pot and circle the earth at the speed of birds, in a way that would astound their elders. Age is hardly better, if at all, suited to teach than youth, as it has gained less than it has lost. One might even question if the wisest person has gained anything of true worth just by living. In reality, the old have no crucial wisdom to offer the young, as their own experiences have been so limited and their lives have been such dismal failures, at least privately, as they must admit. And perhaps they still have some hope that contradicts those experiences, and they are simply less youthful than before. I've been on this earth for about thirty years, and I've yet to hear the first word of useful or sincere guidance from my elders. They've told me nothing of value. Here is life, a largely untested experiment for me, but it doesn't help that they've already tried it.

Some things are really necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.</p>

So he faithfully spends a part of each day making sure his body gets the raw materials it needs for his bones. All the while, he walks behind his oxen, which use their vegetable-grown bones to pull him and his heavy plow forward, despite any obstacles. Some things considered absolute necessities in certain circles, especially among the most vulnerable and ill, are seen as mere luxuries in other groups, and may be completely unknown in still others. </p>

We may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety and strain of some is a well nigh incurable form of disease. We are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do; and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if we had been taken sick? How vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All change is a miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant. Confucius said, “To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.  When one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men at length establish their lives on that basis.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0020"> We can probably trust more than we currently do. We can let go of some self-concern to the degree that we sincerely give it to others. Nature works just as well with our weaknesses as with our strengths. The constant worry and stress some people feel is a nearly untreatable kind of illness. We tend to overstate the significance of the work we do, yet so much isn't done by us! What if we got sick? We're so watchful, insisting on not living by faith if possible. We stay on guard all day, grudgingly say our prayers at night, and surrender to uncertainty. We're genuinely compelled to live this way, honoring our life and rejecting the chance of change. We say it's the only path, but there are as many paths as lines that can be drawn from one point. All change is a wonder to consider, but it's a wonder happening every moment. Confucius said,—“If a State is governed by the principles of reason, poverty and misery are subjects of shame; if a State is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honors are the subjects of shame. Once one person has made an imagined fact into a fact they truly understand, I predict everyone will eventually build their lives on that foundation. </p>

It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of man’s existence; as our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.</p>

We could even look at old store ledgers to see what items people bought most often, what they kept in stock—in other words, the most basic supplies. Because the progress of centuries has not changed much about the fundamental rules of human existence. Our skeletons are probably no different than those of our ancestors. </p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0022">By the words necessary of life, I mean whatever, of all that man obtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain’s shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great surprise, “to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting.  So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity, while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man? According to Liebig, man’s body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm less. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease and death take place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above list, that the expressionanimal life, is nearly synonymous with the expressionanimal heat ; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel which keeps up the fire within us,— and Fuel serves only to prepare that Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from without,— Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the <i>heat</i> thus generated and absorbed.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0022"> The necessities of life refer to the things that humans have always needed or have become essential over time, to the point that few people, regardless of background or beliefs, try to live without them. For many creatures, the only necessity in this sense is Food. Bison on the prairie just need some grass to eat and water to drink, unless they seek Shelter in the forest or mountains. No animal requires more than Food and Shelter. For humans in this climate, the necessities can be categorized as Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel. Only once we have these basics covered can we freely tackle life's true challenges with a chance of success. Humans have created houses, clothes, and cooked food. The accidental discovery of fire's warmth may have turned it from a luxury into a necessity. Pets like cats and dogs also develop this dependence. With proper Shelter and Clothing, we maintain our body heat, but excess Fuel raises our external temperature above the internal, marking the start of cooking. Darwin noted that while his well-clothed team sat comfortably by the fire, naked Tierra del Fuego inhabitants were sweating profusely from the heat despite being farther away. Similarly, native New Hollanders go naked while Europeans shiver in clothes. Can we combine the toughness of these indigenous people with the intellect of the civilized? Liebig compares the human body to a stove, with food as the fuel powering internal combustion in the lungs. We eat more in cold weather and less when it's warm. Body heat comes from slow burning, and overly rapid combustion or lack of fuel leads to illness and death, like a fire going out from issues with the fuel or airflow. While heat and fire differ, the analogy is illustrative. The terms "animal life" and "animal heat" are nearly synonymous, as Food fuels our internal fire, while Fuel prepares Food or adds external warmth, and Shelter and Clothing help retain that generated and absorbed heat. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital heat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor man is wont to complain that this is a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we refer directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook his Food, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various, and more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half unnecessary. At the present day, and in this country, as I find by my own experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, &amp;c., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live,—that is, keep comfortably warm,—and die in New England at last. The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I implied before, they are cooked, of course <i>à la mode</i>.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023"> The main necessity for our bodies is to stay warm and maintain our vital heat. We go to great lengths for this, not only with our food, clothing, and shelter, but also our beds, which are like night-clothes. We even rob bird nests to make this shelter within a shelter, much like how a mole makes a bed of grass and leaves in its burrow! Poor people often complain about this cold world; and many of our problems stem from cold, both physical and social. In some climates, summer allows for an idyllic life. Fuel is only needed for cooking since the sun provides heat, and many fruits are cooked by its rays. Food is also more abundant and easier to get, while clothing and shelter become less necessary. These days, in this country, I've found that a few basic tools like a knife, ax, spade, wheelbarrow, as well as lamplight, paper, and some books, are almost as essential as necessities and can be obtained cheaply. Yet some unwise folks travel to distant, harsh lands and spend decades trading just to live comfortably and eventually die back in New England. The very rich aren't just kept warm, but excessively hot; as I mentioned before, they are cooked fashionably. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0024">Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that <i>we</i> know so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a nobler race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0024"> Most luxuries and many so-called comforts of life are not only unnecessary but actually hinder the progress of humanity. The wisest people have always lived simpler and more frugal lives than the poor. Ancient philosophers from China, India, Persia, and Greece were poorer in material wealth but richer in inner wisdom than any other class. It's remarkable that we know as much about them as we do. The same is true of more recent reformers and benefactors. Only from the vantage point of voluntary poverty can one be an impartial and wise observer of human life. A life of luxury yields luxury, whether in farming, business, writing, or art. Today there are philosophy professors, but not true philosophers. Yet it's admirable to teach philosophy because it was once admirable to live it. Being a philosopher isn't just about having deep thoughts or starting a school, but loving wisdom enough to live simply, independently, generously, and with trust. It means solving life's problems, not just in theory but in practice. Great scholars and thinkers often achieve courtly success, not kingly or manly success. They get by merely by conforming, living much as their fathers did, and don't father a nobler generation. But why do people always decline? What causes families to die out? What is the nature of the luxury that weakens and ruins nations? Are we certain our own lives are free of it? The philosopher is ahead of his time even in his outward lifestyle. He doesn't eat, live, dress, or stay warm like his peers. How can one be a philosopher without sustaining his vital heat through better means than others? </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0025">When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more numerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?—for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their root, and often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in their flowering season.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0025"> When a person has been warmed in the ways I've described, what do they want next? Certainly not more of the same warmth, like extra and fancier food, bigger and grander homes, nicer and more plentiful clothes, more frequent and hotter fires, and so on. Once they've obtained life's necessities, there's another option besides pursuing luxuries; they can now embark on life itself, their break from humbler work having begun. The soil, it seems, suits the seed, as it has grown its root downward and can now confidently send its shoot upward too. Why has man anchored himself so securely in the earth, if not to rise proportionally into the skies above? After all, the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they ultimately bear in the air and light, far above the ground, and aren't treated like the lowlier vegetables which, though they may live two years, are grown only until their root is mature, and often cut down at the top for this purpose, so that most wouldn't recognize them when flowering. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0026">I do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who will mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance build more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest, without ever impoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,—if, indeed, there are any such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who find their encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition of things, and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of lovers,—and, to some extent, I reckon myself in this number; I do not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or not;—but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.</p>

I also don't speak to those who find their motivation and inspiration in the current state of affairs, and adore it with a lover's passion and zeal—to an extent, I count myself in this group. I'm not addressing those who are content in their work, whatever their situation, and they know if they're content or not. Instead, I'm mainly talking to the majority who are dissatisfied and complaining idly about their tough circumstances or the times, when they could make things better. Some complain the loudest and most hopelessly, claiming they're just doing their duty.

I nearly used up all my resources on it, even losing my breath in the process, as I ran into the gusts. If it had been related to politics, you can be sure it would have been reported in the newspaper right away. Other times, I watched from a cliff or tree like an observatory, to signal any new things coming. Or I waited on the hills at dusk for the night sky to arrive, hoping to catch something, although I never caught much. And what I did catch would melt away in the sun like manna. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0032">For a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide circulation, whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I got only my labor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their own reward.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0032"> For many years I worked as a reporter for a small magazine. The editor never published most of my articles, and like many writers, I was not paid for my efforts. However, in this situation, the experience itself was rewarding enough. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0033">For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain storms, and did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths and all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines bridged and passable at all seasons, where the public heel had testified to their utility.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0033"> For a long time, I was the unofficial overseer of blizzards and downpours, diligently carrying out my responsibilities. I served as the inspector, if not of roads, then of woodland trails and shortcuts, ensuring they remained accessible and that gorges were crossed by bridges in all weather, wherever the public had shown they were needed. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0034">I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful herdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an eye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not always know whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field to-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have withered else in dry seasons.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0034"> I've tended to the town's wild animals, which often trouble a devoted shepherd by jumping fences. I've also watched over the farm's remote areas, though I didn't always know which field Jonas or Solomon worked in each day—that wasn't my concern. During dry spells, I watered the red huckleberry, sand cherry, nettle tree, red pine, black ash, white grape and yellow violet, which otherwise may have dried up and died. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0035">In short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without boasting, faithfully minding my business, till it became more and more evident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of town officers, nor make my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance. My accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed, never got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled. However, I have not set my heart on that.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0035"> In summary, I continued in this manner for an extended period. I can say without bragging that I diligently attended to my work, until it became increasingly clear that the people in my town would ultimately not include me among the town officials, or give me an easy job with a decent salary. Although I can swear that I have always kept my financial records honestly, they have never been audited, much less approved, paid or resolved. However, that has never been my main focus or desire. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0036">Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. “Do you wish to buy any baskets?  he asked. “No, we do not want any,  was the reply. “What!  exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you mean to starve us?  Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off,—that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic, wealth and standing followed, he had said to himself; I will go into business; I will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be the white man’s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was necessary for him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them, or at least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture, but I had not made it worth any one’s while to buy them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men’s while to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0036"> Recently, a wandering Native American tried to sell baskets at a prominent lawyer's house nearby. "Want to buy baskets?" he asked. "No, we don't need any," they answered. "What!" the man cried as he left, "you want us to go hungry?" He saw his hard-working white neighbors thriving—the lawyer just had to spin arguments and wealth and status magically followed. He thought, "I'll go into business weaving baskets, something I can do". He assumed making the baskets was enough, then the white man would buy them. He didn't realize he had to make them appealing to buy, or at least seem so, or make something else worth buying. I had also woven a delicate kind of basket, but didn't make anyone want to buy them. Still, I thought weaving them was worthwhile. Instead of figuring out how to make my baskets desirable, I focused on not needing to sell them. The life people admire and consider successful is just one type. Why overemphasize one at the others' expense? </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0037">Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in the court house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must shift for myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the woods, where I was better known. I determined to go into business at once, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender means as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0037"> Realizing that my neighbors were unlikely to provide me with space in the courthouse or any church position, I knew I had to fend for myself. I focused even more on the forest, where people knew me better. I decided to start working immediately, not waiting to gain the typical funds, using the limited resources I already had. My goal in moving to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply or expensively, but to take care of some personal matters with minimal hurdles. To be stopped from achieving this due to a lack of practicality, initiative and business skills, seemed not as much sad as it did unwise. </p>

If your trade is with the Celestial Empire, then some small counting house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will be fixture enough. You will export such articles as the country affords, purely native products, much ice and pine timber and a little granite, always in native bottoms. These will be good ventures. To oversee all the details yourself in person; to be at once pilot and captain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and sell and keep the accounts; to read every letter received, and write or read every letter sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be upon many parts of the coast almost at the same time;—often the richest freight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;—to be your own telegraph, unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise; to keep up a steady despatch of commodities, for the supply of such a distant and exorbitant market; to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets, prospects of war and peace every where, and anticipate the tendencies of trade and civilization,—taking advantage of the results of all exploring expeditions, using new passages and all improvements in navigation;—charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pier,—there is the untold fate of La Perouse;—universal science to be kept pace with, studying the lives of all great discoverers and navigators, great adventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the Phœnicians down to our day; in fine, account of stock to be taken from time to time, to know how you stand. It is a labor to task the faculties of a man,—such problems of profit and loss, of interest, of tare and tret, and gauging of all kinds in it, as demand a universal knowledge.</p>

Oversee all the details yourself; be the pilot, captain, owner and insurer; buy, sell and do the accounting; read every letter you get, and write or read every one you send; supervise unloading imports day and night, often on a Jersey shore. Be your own telegraph, tirelessly watching the horizon, hailing all passing coastal vessels. Steadily ship goods to supply a distant, demanding market. Stay informed about market conditions and prospects for war and peace everywhere, and predict trade and civilization trends. Take advantage of all expeditions' findings, use new routes and navigation improvements. Study charts, learn the locations of reefs, lights and buoys, and always update the navigation tables, since a calculator's error can wreck a ship that should have reached a friendly pier—that's the unknown fate of La Perouse. Keep up with universal science, studying the lives of all great explorers, navigators, adventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the Phoenicians to today. Regularly take stock to know your financial position. It's a job that challenges a man's abilities, with complex problems of profit and loss, interest, allowances, and all kinds of measurement, requiring comprehensive knowledge. </p>

No Neva marshes to be filled; though you must every where build on piles of your own driving. It is said that a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the Neva, would sweep St. Petersburg from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0039"> I've considered Walden Pond as a great spot for business, and not just because of the railroad and ice trade. It has benefits that may be best kept secret. It's a good harbor with a solid base. No Neva swamps need filling, but you'll have to build on your own pilings everywhere.

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0040">As this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it may not be easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be indispensable to every such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing, to come at once to the practical part of the question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty, and a regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that the object of clothing is, first, to retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to cover nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer’s character, until we hesitate to lay them aside, without such delay and medical appliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the rent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this;—who could wear a patch, or two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a gentleman’s legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We know but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest salute the scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog that barked at every stranger who approached his master’s premises with clothes on, but was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell surely of any company of civilized men, which belonged to the most respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she “was now in a civilized country, where —— — people are judged of by their clothes.  Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental possession of wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain for the possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect, numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary sent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which you may call endless; a woman’s dress, at least, is never done.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0040"> Entering this business without the usual capital may make it difficult to obtain the necessary means. When it comes to clothing, we may be driven more by novelty and others' opinions than true utility. To focus on what's practical, remember that clothing's purpose is firstly to retain body heat, and secondly to cover nakedness in society. Consider how much important work can be done without adding to your wardrobe. Even kings and queens, who wear a suit only once, can't know the comfort of a well-fitting outfit. They're no better than wooden hangers for clean clothes. Our garments become more a part of us each day, taking on our character, until we hesitate to remove them without ceremony. I never think less of someone for wearing patched clothes; yet people commonly care more about having fashionable or clean clothes than a clear conscience. At worst, an unmended tear may betray a lack of planning. I test my friends by asking who could wear a patched knee. Most act as if it would ruin their life prospects, finding it easier to limp around with a broken leg than ripped pants. A gentleman's injured legs can be fixed, but damaged pants are hopeless, because he cares about others' respect over self-respect. We recognize many coats and breeches, but few men. Dress a scarecrow in your clothes and see who greets it first. Passing a cornfield, I recognized the farmer by his hat and coat on a stake, only slightly more weathered. A dog reportedly barked at clothed strangers but was calmed by a naked thief. It's interesting to consider how people's status would change if they were stripped of their clothes. In such a case, could you tell which company of civilized men was most respected? Even the adventurous Madam Pfeiffer felt compelled to change from her traveling clothes to meet authorities once in "civilized" Asiatic Russia, where "people are judged by their clothes". In our democratic New England towns, the mere possession and display of wealth through clothing and possessions earns nearly universal respect. But those offering such respect are quite heathen and need missionaries. Besides, clothing has made sewing endless work, as a woman's dress is never finished. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0041">A man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit to do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an indeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet,—if a hero ever has a valet,—bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go to soirées and legislative halls must have new coats, coats to change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes,—his old coat, actually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to <i>do with</i>, but something to <i>do</i>, or rather something to <i>be</i>. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors, and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0041"> A person who has finally found their calling won't need new clothes to pursue it; their old garments, gathering dust in the attic for who knows how long, will suffice. A hero's old shoes will last longer than those of his servant—if heroes even have servants. Bare feet are older than shoes, and the hero can make do with them. Only those attending parties and legislative halls must have new jackets, changing them as often as the person inside changes. But if my jacket, pants, hat, and shoes are suitable for worshiping God, they'll do just fine, won't they? Who has seen their old clothes—their old coat—truly worn out, broken down to its basic elements, such that giving it to a poor boy would be an act of charity? That boy might then pass it on to someone even poorer, or perhaps wealthier, who could manage with less. I say, be wary of any undertaking requiring new clothes, rather than a new wearer of clothes. If there isn't a new person, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have a venture ahead, try it in your old outfit. Everyone wants not just something to do, but something to be. Maybe we should never get new clothes, no matter how tattered or dirty the old ones are, until we have acted or ventured in a way that makes us feel like new people in the old garments. Keeping the old clothes then would be like putting new wine in old wineskins. Our molting season, like that of birds, must be a pivotal moment in our lives. The loon retreats to isolated ponds for this time. The snake sheds its skin and the caterpillar its wormy cocoon through an inner transformation and growth, for clothes are just our outermost layer and mortal coil. If not, we'll be caught sailing under false colors and inevitably dismissed by both our own conscience and the judgment of humanity. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0042">We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition without. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber or true bark, which cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man. I believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is desirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the dark, and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly, that, if an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the gate empty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most purposes, as good as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be obtained at prices really to suit customers; while a thick coat can be bought for five dollars, which will last as many years, thick pantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a dollar and a half a pair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter cap for sixty-two and a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal cost, where is he so poor that, clad in such a suit, of <i>his own earning</i>, there will not be found wise men to do him reverence?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0042"> We put on layer after layer of clothing, as if we grew like plants by adding on the outside. Our outer clothes are often thin and decorative, like a false skin that doesn't really connect to our life. We can remove these outer layers here and there without much harm, like how plants shed their epidermis. Our thicker, regularly worn clothes are like a plant's cortex. But our shirts are our true bark that can't be taken off without cutting into us and destroying the person. I think all people wear something like a shirt in some seasons. A person should dress simply enough to be able to find himself in the dark. He should live efficiently and readily, so if an enemy attacks the town, he can walk out the gate with nothing, unworried, like the old philosopher. One thick garment works as well as three thin ones for most things. Affordable clothes can be found at prices that work for buyers. A thick coat for five dollars lasts many years. Thick pants for two dollars, leather boots for $1.50 a pair, a summer hat for twenty-five cents, a winter cap for sixty-two cents—or a better homemade one for little cost. If someone earns an outfit like this themselves, what wise person wouldn't respect them, no matter how poor? </p>

When I hear this oracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing to myself each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it, that I may find out by what degree of consanguinity <i>They</i> are related to <i>me</i>, and what authority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly; and, finally, I am inclined to answer her with equal mystery, and without any more emphasis of the “they, —“It is true, they did not make them so recently, but they do now.  Of what use this measuring of me if she does not measure my character, but only the breadth of my shoulders, as it were a peg to hang the coat on? We worship not the Graces, nor the Parcæ, but Fashion. She spins and weaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey at Paris puts on a traveller’s cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same. I sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in this world by the help of men. They would have to be passed through a powerful press first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that they would not soon get upon their legs again, and then there would be some one in the company with a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg deposited there nobody knows when, for not even fire kills these things, and you would have lost your labor.

I find it challenging to have what I want made, simply because she can't believe I mean what I say, that I am so bold. When I hear this prophetic statement, I'm momentarily lost in thought, emphasizing each word to myself to grasp its meaning, to determine how closely They are related to me, and what authority they have in a matter that concerns me so deeply. Finally, I'm tempted to respond with equal mystery, without further emphasis on "they"—"It's true, they didn't make them that way recently, but they do now". What's the point of measuring me if she doesn't assess my character, only the width of my shoulders, as if I were merely a peg to hang the coat on? We don't worship the Graces or the Fates, but rather Fashion. She spins, weaves, and cuts with full authority. The head monkey in Paris dons a traveler's cap, and all the monkeys in America follow suit. Sometimes I despair of getting anything simple and honest done in this world with the help of men.

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0044">On the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or any country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make shift to wear what they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on what they can find on the beach, and at a little distance, whether of space or time, laugh at each other’s masquerade. Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. We are amused at beholding the costume of Henry VIII., or Queen Elizabeth, as much as if it was that of the King and Queen of the Cannibal Islands. All costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be taken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that mood too. When the soldier is hit by a cannon ball rags are as becoming as purple.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0044"> Overall, I don't think it can be said that fashion has become an art form in this or any other country. Right now, people just wear what they can get their hands on. Like castaways, they put on whatever they find on the shore, and after some time or distance, poke fun at each other's odd outfits. Each generation mocks the old styles but devotedly follows the new trends. We find the clothing of Henry VIII or Queen Elizabeth as amusing as the garb of a tribal king and queen. Any costume looks sad or silly on a person. Only a serious gaze and a sincere life lived beneath the attire can stop onlookers from laughing and make the fashion of any culture seem sacred. If a clown gets a stomach ache, his flashy outfit has to work for that mood as well. When a soldier is struck by a cannonball, rags are as fitting as a purple robe. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0045">The childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps how many shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may discover the particular figure which this generation requires today. The manufacturers have learned that this taste is merely whimsical. Of two patterns which differ only by a few threads more or less of a particular color, the one will be sold readily, the other lie on the shelf, though it frequently happens that after the lapse of a season the latter becomes the most fashionable. Comparatively, tattooing is not the hideous custom which it is called. It is not barbarous merely because the printing is skin-deep and unalterable.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0045"> People's immature and primitive preference for new designs keeps many peering through kaleidoscopes, hoping to find the pattern that's currently in demand. Manufacturers know this taste is simply fickle. Between two designs with only slight color differences, one will sell well while the other sits unsold. Yet often, after a season, the unpopular pattern later becomes trendy. Relatively speaking, tattooing is not as awful a practice as it's made out to be.

The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high.</p>

Samuel Laing says that “the Laplander in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his head and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow—in a degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in any woollen clothing.  He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he adds, “They are not hardier than other people.  But, probably, man did not live long on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family; though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is unnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost solely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the symbol of a day’s march, and a row of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times they had camped. Man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must seek to narrow his world, and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at first bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and warm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing of the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve, according to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home, a place of warmth, or comfort, first of physical warmth, then the warmth of the affections.</p>

But humans probably didn't live long on Earth without discovering the convenience of having a house and the domestic comforts, which may have originally meant the pleasures of the house more than the family. However, these must be very limited and occasional in climates where the house is mainly associated with winter or the rainy season in our minds, and is unnecessary for two-thirds of the year, except as a sunshade. In our climate in the summer, it was previously almost only a covering at night. In Indian newspapers, a wigwam symbolized a day's journey, and a row of them cut or drawn on tree bark indicated how many times they had camped. Man wasn't made so large and strong that he didn't have to try to shrink his world and enclose a space that suited him. At first he was naked and outdoors, but while this was nice enough in calm and warm weather during the day, the rainy season and winter, not to mention the hot sun, might have stopped his species early on if he hadn't quickly dressed himself with the protection of a house. According to the story, Adam and Eve wore the bower before other clothes. Humans needed a home, a place of warmth or comfort, first for physical warmth, then for the warmth of emotions.</span> </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0048">We may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some enterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every child begins the world again, to some extent, and loves to stay out doors, even in wet and cold. It plays house, as well as horse, having an instinct for it. Who does not remember the interest with which when young he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach to a cave? It was the natural yearning of that portion of our most primitive ancestor which still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of palm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass and straw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we know not what it is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic in more senses than we think. From the hearth to the field is a great distance. It would be well perhaps if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0048"> We can picture a time in the early days of humanity when an adventurous person sought shelter in a rocky cave. Every child starts life anew to some degree, enjoying the outdoors even in rainy, chilly weather. They play house and horse, having a natural instinct for it. Who can't recall the fascination they felt as a child looking at overhanging rocks or anything resembling a cave? It was the innate longing of the part of our ancient ancestor that lived on in us. From caves, we progressed to roofs made of palm fronds, bark, branches, woven linen, grass, straw, wood, shingles, stone, and tile. Now, we have forgotten what it's like to live outdoors, and our lives are more sheltered than we realize. It's a long way from the hearth to the open field. Perhaps we'd be better off spending more time directly under the stars and planets, if poets and saints weren't so accustomed to being indoors. Birds don't sing in caves, and doves don't nurture their purity in cages. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0049">However, if one designs to construct a dwelling house, it behooves him to exercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself in a workhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a prison, or a splendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this town, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a foot deep around them, and I thought that they would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when how to get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a question which vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am become somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six feet long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at night, and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least, get into it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid, and so have freedom in his love, and in his soul be free. This did not appear the worst, nor by any means a despicable alternative. You could sit up as late as you pleased, and, whenever you got up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord dogging you for rent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being treated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable house for a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once made here almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished ready to their hands. Gookin, who was superintendent of the Indians subject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, “The best of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up, and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they are green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but not so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet long and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams, and found them as warm as the best English houses.  He adds, that they were commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were furnished with various utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge was in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one, or its apartment in one.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0049"> However, if one plans to build a house, it pays to be a little shrewd, or else he may end up in a confusing maze, a museum, a prison, or a fancy tomb. Think about how little shelter is truly needed. I've seen Indians in this town living in thin cotton tents with nearly a foot of snow around them, and thought they'd be happy to have even more snow to block the wind. When I used to worry more about making an honest living while having time for my interests, I would see these large boxes by the railroad, six feet long and three wide, where workers locked up their tools. It made me realize any struggling man could get one for a dollar, drill some air holes, and crawl in at night, having freedom in his heart and soul. This seemed a decent option. You could stay up late and come and go without a landlord hounding you. Many a man is worked to death paying rent on a fancier box, but wouldn't freeze in one like this. I'm quite serious. The economy is a topic that can be treated lightly, but shouldn't be dismissed. A cozy home for hardy people who mostly lived outdoors was once made here using materials Nature provided. Gookin, an overseer of the Indians in the 1670s, said their best houses were covered tightly and warmly with tree bark stripped off in great sheets when the sap was running. The poorer ones used mats made of bulrush, which were also fairly snug and warm, though not as good. Some were sixty to one hundred feet long and thirty feet wide. Gookin often stayed in their wigwams and found them as warm as the best English houses. They even had carpeting, embroidered mats, and various tools. The Indians were advanced enough to control drafts with a mat hung over the roof hole, moved by a string. Such a home could be built in a day or two and taken apart in hours, with every family owning one. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0050">In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage’s. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars, these are the country rates, entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a <i>poor</i> civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man,—and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages,—it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer’s life, even if he is not encumbered with a family;—estimating the pecuniary value of every man’s labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;—so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before <i>his</i> wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0050"> In the primitive world, every family has a shelter as good as any other, sufficient for their basic needs. However, I believe that in modern society, although birds have nests, foxes have dens, and primitive people have huts, less than half of families actually own a home. In big cities, where civilization is most advanced, home ownership is very rare. The majority pay yearly for this essential outer covering, summer and winter, an amount that could buy a village of primitive huts, but instead keeps them in lifelong poverty. I'm not arguing that renting is worse than owning, but clearly primitive man owns his shelter because it's so cheap, while modern man usually rents because he can't afford to buy. But can he really afford the rent either, in the long run? Some say that by paying this rent, the poor modern man gets a home that's a palace compared to a primitive hut. A yearly rent of $25 to $100 in rural areas gives him the advantage of centuries of progress—large rooms, clean finishes, an efficient fireplace, insulation, window coverings, running water, a lock, a roomy basement, and more. But why is it that the one who supposedly enjoys these things is often a poor modern man, while the primitive man, lacking them, is rich by comparison? If civilization really improves the human condition—and I believe it does, though only the wise make use of it—then it must provide better housing without higher cost. The cost of something is the amount of life that must be traded for it, now or later. A typical house here costs maybe $800, and saving that much takes ten to fifteen years of a worker's life, even without a family to support. Figuring each person's labor is worth a dollar per day on average, he spends over half his life saving before his home is paid for. Renting is a questionable alternative. Would the primitive man have been wise to trade his hut for a palace on those terms? </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0051">It may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding this superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far as the individual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral expenses. But perhaps a man is not required to bury himself. Nevertheless this points to an important distinction between the civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt, they have designs on us for our benefit, in making the life of a civilized people an <i>institution</i>, in which the life of the individual is to a great extent absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage without suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that the poor ye have always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0051"> It could be assumed that I consider the main benefit of having this extra property as a reserve for the future—at least for the individual—is to cover burial costs. But maybe a person doesn't have to bury themselves. Still, this highlights a key difference between the civilized person and the uncivilized one; and they likely have plans for us to help us by making the life of civilized people an established system in which the individual life is largely consumed in order to maintain and improve the life of the species. However, I want to illustrate the great cost at which this benefit is currently gained and to propose that we may be able to live in a way that gains all the benefits without experiencing any of the drawbacks. What mean ye by saying that the poor ye have always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge? </p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0054">When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought with hired money,—and we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of their houses,—but commonly they have not paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances sometimes outweigh the value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town who own their farms free and clear. If you would know the history of these homesteads, inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man who has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in Concord. What has been said of the merchants, that a very large majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to fail, is equally true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements, because it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that breaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and suggests, beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in saving their souls, but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they who fail honestly. Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but the savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex Cattle Show goes off here with <i>éclat</i> annually, as if all the joints of the agricultural machine were suent.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0054"> When I look at my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well off as other groups, I see that most have been working for twenty, thirty, or forty years to truly own their farms. They often inherited these farms with debt or bought them with borrowed money. About a third of their work has gone towards paying for their houses, which many still haven't finished paying off. Sometimes the debt is more than the farm is worth, making the farm itself a huge burden. Yet someone always inherits it, claiming to know it well. The town assessors surprised me by saying they can't even name a dozen people in town who own their farms outright. To learn the history of these properties, just ask the bank that holds the mortgages. A farmer who has paid for his land by working it is so uncommon that everyone knows who he is. I doubt there are even three such men in Concord. Just like merchants, of whom 97% are said to fail, farmers almost always fail too. For merchants though, many of these "failures" are not true financial failures, but simply a failure to meet commitments because it's inconvenient. In other words, it's their character that fails. However, this makes the situation far worse and suggests that perhaps not even the successful 3% manage to keep their integrity. They may be morally bankrupt, which is worse than failing honestly. Bankruptcy and defaulting are the springboards that much of our society uses to vault forward, while the poor remain trapped by hunger. Yet the Middlesex Cattle Show happens here each year with great fanfare, as if the entire system of farming were running smoothly. </p>

While civilization has been improving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings. And if the civilized man’s pursuits are no worthier than the savage’s, if he is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely, why should he have a better dwelling than the former? </p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0061">But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found, that just in proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage, others have been degraded below him. The luxury of one class is counterbalanced by the indigence of another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are the almshouse and “silent poor.  The myriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed on garlic, and it may be were not decently buried themselves. The mason who finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to suppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich. To know this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties which every where border our railroads, that last improvement in civilization; where I see in my daily walks human beings living in sties, and all winter with an open door, for the sake of light, without any visible, often imaginable, wood pile, and the forms of both old and young are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from cold and misery, and the development of all their limbs and faculties is checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose labor the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too, to a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of every denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the world. Or I could refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots on the map. Contrast the physical condition of the Irish with that of the North American Indian, or the South Sea Islander, or any other savage race before it was degraded by contact with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that people’s rulers are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their condition only proves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly need refer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple exports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the South. But to confine myself to those who are said to be in <i>moderate</i> circumstances.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0061"> But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be discovered that as some have risen above the savage in external circumstances, others have fallen below him. The affluence of one class is offset by the poverty of another. On one side stands the mansion; on the other, the poorhouse and "silent poor." The countless workers who erected the pyramids to entomb the pharaohs ate garlic and perhaps were not properly buried themselves. The stoneworker who completes the palace cornice may return at night to a shack inferior to a hut. It is wrong to assume that in a land with the usual signs of civilization, the state of many inhabitants cannot be as low as that of primitives. I speak of the impoverished poor, not the corrupt rich. To know this, I need not look beyond the hovels lining our railroads, that latest advance in civilization; where on my walks I see humans dwelling in pigpens, all winter with an open door for light, without any visible, often unimaginable, woodpile, their bodies permanently hunched from long exposure to cold and hardship, their limbs and abilities stunted. It is reasonable to consider the class whose labor achieves the works that mark this era. Such, to varying degrees, is also the lot of workers of all kinds in England, the great workshop of the world. Or I could point to Ireland, marked as an enlightened spot on the map. Compare the physical state of the Irish to the North American Indian, South Sea Islander, or any other primitive people before being debased by contact with civilized man. Yet I am sure their leaders are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their plight merely shows what squalor can coexist with civilization. I hardly need to mention the workers in our Southern States who produce this country's chief exports and are themselves a chief Southern product. But let me limit myself to those said to be moderately well off. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0062">Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him, or, gradually leaving off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin, complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely teach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man’s providing a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas, and empty guest chambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should not our furniture be as simple as the Arab’s or the Indian’s? When I think of the benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as messengers from heaven, bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in my mind any retinue at their heels, any car-load of fashionable furniture. Or what if I were to allow—would it not be a singular allowance?—that our furniture should be more complex than the Arab’s, in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors! At present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it, and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole, and not leave her morning’s work undone. Morning work! By the blushes of Aurora and the music of Memnon, what should be man’s <i>morning work</i> in this world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and I threw them out the window in disgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit in the open air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0062"> Most people seem to have never thought about what a house really is, and they end up poor their whole lives because they think they need a house like their neighbors'. It's like wearing any coat the tailor makes, or slowly giving up a hat made of leaves or a cap made of woodchuck fur, and then complaining about hard times because you can't afford a crown! We could invent an even fancier house that everyone would agree is too expensive. Should we keep trying to get more of these things, or sometimes be happy with less? Should respectable people seriously teach young people that they need extra shoes, umbrellas, and empty guest rooms before they die? Why can't our furniture be as simple as an Arab's or a Native American's? When I think of the great people we treat like heaven-sent heroes, I don't picture them with a bunch of fancy furniture. What if I said our furniture should be fancier than an Arab's, in proportion to how much morally and intellectually better we are? Right now, our houses are cluttered with junk, and a good housewife would throw most of it out, leaving her morning chores undone. Morning chores! What should a person's morning work in this world be? I had three limestone rocks on my desk, but I was horrified that they needed daily dusting when my mind was still undusted, so I tossed them out the window in disgust. How could I keep a furnished house then? I'd rather sit outside, since no dust gathers on the grass, except where people have dug up the ground. </p>

The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated. I think that in the railroad car we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience, and it threatens without attaining these to become no better than a modern drawing room, with its divans, and ottomans, and sun-shades, and a hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west with us, invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the Celestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of. I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart with a free circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe a <i>malaria</i> all the way.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0063"> The wealthy and indulgent set the trends that the masses eagerly follow. Travelers who stay at the finest establishments quickly realize this, as the innkeepers assume them to be hedonists. Yielding to their indulgences would soon leave one entirely depleted. It seems we prioritize luxury over safety and practicality in train cars, nearly turning them into lavish living rooms filled with sofas, footstools, parasols, and countless exotic items from the East. These frivolous things, made for harem girls and the soft men of China, are what Jonathan should be embarrassed to recognize. I'd sooner sit alone on a humble pumpkin than be cramped on a plush velvet seat. I'd prefer a bumpy ride in an open ox cart, than a trip to paradise in a fussy excursion car, breathing in the stale air the whole way. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0064">The very simplicity and nakedness of man’s life in the primitive ages imply this advantage at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of <i>agri</i> -culture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man’s struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of <i>fine</i> art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantel-piece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the <i>fine</i> arts which adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the ninety-seven who fail, or of the three who succeed? Answer me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is no house and no housekeeper.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0064"> The simplicity and bareness of primitive life had this benefit: man was still just a visitor in nature. After eating and sleeping, he continued his journey. He lived in a tent, threading valleys, crossing plains, or climbing mountains. But now, men have become slaves to their tools. The man who once picked fruit when hungry became a farmer; he who took shelter under a tree, a homeowner. We've settled on earth, forgetting heaven. We adopted Christianity as just a better farming method. We built a mansion for this life, a tomb for the next. Art tries to free man from this, but only makes this low state bearable and heaven forgotten. There's no place here for fine art to stand; our lives and homes give it no pedestal. No nail to hang a painting, no shelf for a hero's bust. Seeing how our houses are built and managed, I'm amazed the floor doesn't collapse under visitors admiring trinkets, dropping them into the cellar's honest, earthy foundation. I see this "rich, refined" life as an illusion, and can't enjoy the arts adorning it, fixated on the facade. I recall the farthest genuine leap by human muscles alone: wandering Arabs clearing 25 feet on flat ground. Without artificial support, man falls back to earth beyond that. I'm tempted to ask the owner of such impropriety: Who props you up? Are you among the 97 who fail or 3 who succeed? Answer that, then maybe I'll see your baubles as ornaments. The cart before the horse is neither pretty nor practical. Before decorating homes with beautiful things, the walls and our lives must be stripped bare, with beautiful housekeeping and living as the foundation. A taste for beauty is best cultivated outdoors, with no house or housekeeper. </p>

The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the beginning of the colonies, commenced their first dwelling houses in this fashion for two reasons; firstly, in order not to waste time in building, and not to want food the next season; secondly, in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four years, when the country became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves handsome houses, spending on them several thousands. </p>

But are the more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of acquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred, for, so to speak, the country is not yet adapted to <i>human</i> culture, and we are still forced to cut our <i>spiritual</i> bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all architectural ornament is to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.</p>

But are the most pressing needs met today? When I consider getting one of our extravagant homes for myself, I hesitate because, in a sense, the nation is not yet ready for human development, and we still have to spread our spiritual nourishment much thinner than our ancestors did their wheat bread. It's not that all architectural decoration should be ignored, even in the most primitive times, but let our homes first be filled with beauty where they touch our lives, like a shellfish's dwelling, rather than being covered with it on the outside.

In such a neighborhood as this, boards and shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily obtained than suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or even well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak understandingly on this subject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both theoretically and practically. With a little more wit we might use these materials so as to become richer than the richest now are, and make our civilization a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage.

I know what I'm talking about, as I've looked into this in theory and practice. With a bit more cleverness, we could use these building materials to become wealthier than the richest people now, and turn our modern society into a real blessing.

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0068">Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some open spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated with water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the most part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the winter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life. I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0068"> In late March 1845, I borrowed an ax and headed to the woods near Walden Pond, close to where I planned to build my house. I started cutting down some tall, slender white pines that were still young, to use for timber. It's hard to start without borrowing, but it may be the most generous way to let others take part in your project. The axe's owner said it was precious to him as he let it go, but I gave it back sharper than when I got it. I worked on a nice hillside, covered in pine woods, with a view of the pond and a small clearing where pines and hickories were growing. The pond ice hadn't melted yet, though there were some open areas, and it was all dark-colored and soaked with water. There was a bit of snow while I worked, but mostly when I came out to the railroad to go home, its yellow sand stretched out shining in the hazy air, and the rails gleamed in the spring sun. I heard the lark, pewee, and other birds already back to start another year with us. Those were nice spring days when both the earth and people's winter blues were thawing, and dormant life began to awaken. One day, when my ax head came off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, hammering it with a stone and leaving it to soak in a pond to expand the wood, I saw a striped snake swim into the water. It stayed on the bottom, seemingly comfortable, for as long as I was there, over fifteen minutes, maybe because it hadn't fully come out of hibernation yet. It seemed to me that people stay in their current low and basic state for a similar reason; but if they felt the effect of the spring of springs stirring them, they would inevitably rise to a higher and more spiritual life. I had seen snakes before on frosty mornings, parts of their bodies still numb and stiff, waiting for the sun to warm them. On April 1, it rained and melted the ice, and early in the very foggy day, I heard a lone goose flying over the pond, honking as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog itself. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0069">So I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs and rafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or scholar-like thoughts, singing to myself,—</p>

Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this time. My days in the woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them, having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had made.</p>

I had already bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins’ shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun. Door-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were“good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window, —of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents to-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all,—bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,—all but the cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.</p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0073">I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed it to the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day, and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation; there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of Troy.</p>

The sides were left shelving, and not stoned; but the sun having never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place. It was but two hours’ work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground, for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable temperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after the superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth. The house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow.</p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0075">At length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my acquaintances, rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was ever more honored in the character of his raisers than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the raising of loftier structures one day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of July, as soon as it was boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully feather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain; but before boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the chimney after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth, doing my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground, early in the morning: which mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than the usual one. When it stormed before my bread was baked, I fixed a few boards over the fire, and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way. In those days, when my hands were much employed, I read but little, but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or tablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the same purpose as the Iliad.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0075"> Is all that any body knows. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0076">It would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I did, considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a cellar, a garret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never raising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal necessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a man’s building his own house that there is in a bird’s building its own nest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so engaged? But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong to the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man; it is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this division of labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt another <i>may</i> also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0076"> I cut the main beams to six inches square, leaving bark on two sides of most studs and one side of rafters and floor joists. This kept them straighter and stronger than sawed lumber. I carefully joined each piece using mortise and tenon, with borrowed tools. My time in the forest was brief, but I often ate my bread and butter wrapped in newspaper at midday, sitting among the pine branches I had cut. Their scent infused my bread as pitch coated my hands. In the end, I befriended the pines despite having felled some, growing more familiar with them. Occasionally a passerby heard my ax and we conversed pleasantly over the wood chips I created. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0077">True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps from his point of view, but only a little better than the common dilettantism. A sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the cornice, not at the foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within the ornaments, that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or caraway seed in it,—though I hold that almonds are most wholesome without the sugar,—and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might build truly within and without, and let the ornaments take care of themselves. What reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the skin merely,—that the tortoise got his spotted shell, or the shellfish its mother-o’-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of Broadway their Trinity Church? But a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes. This man seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward, out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is the only builder,—out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in this country, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in their surfaces merely, which makes them <i>picturesque;</i> and equally interesting will be the citizen’s suburban box, when his life shall be as simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion of architectural ornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale would strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without injury to the substantials. They can do without <i>architecture</i> who have no olives nor wines in the cellar. What if an equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature, and the architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the architects of our churches do? So are made the <i>belles-lettres</i> and the <i>beaux-arts</i> and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a few sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are daubed upon his box. It would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest <i>sensehe</i> slanted them and daubed it; but the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of a piece with constructing his own coffin,—the architecture of the grave, and “carpenter  is but another name for “coffin-maker.  One man says, in his despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the earth at your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last and narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of leisure he must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better paint your house your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for you. An enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture! When you have got my ornaments ready I will wear them.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0077"> By mid-April, as I took my time with the work, my house was framed and ready to be raised. I had already purchased the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad, for the boards. Collins' shanty was seen as an unusually nice one. When I visited, he wasn't home. I walked around the outside, initially unseen from within due to the deep, high window. It was small, with a peaked cottage roof, and little else visible, with dirt piled up five feet all around like a compost heap. The roof was the sturdiest part, though warped and brittle from the sun. There was no door-sill, just a constant passage for hens under the door board. Mrs. Collins came to the door and invited me to see the inside. The hens scattered as I approached. It was dark with a mostly dirt floor, damp, chilly, and sickly, with only a few boards that couldn't be removed. She lit a lamp to show me the roof and walls, and that the board floor went under the bed, cautioning me not to step into the two-foot deep cellar dust hole. In her words, there were "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"—originally two whole squares, but the cat had recently left that way. Inside was a stove, bed, place to sit, a newborn, silk parasol, gilt-framed mirror, and new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling. The deal was quickly made, as James had returned. I paid $4.25 that night, he would leave at 5 AM, selling to no one else. I would take over at 6 AM. He advised coming early to avoid vague but unfair claims about rent and fuel. This, he said, was the only issue. At 6 AM, I passed him and his family on the road, carrying all their belongings in one large bundle—bed, coffee-mill, mirror, hens—everything but the cat, who went to the woods, became wild, and later died in a woodchuck trap. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0078">Before winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house, which were already impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first slice of the log, whose edges I was obliged to straighten with a plane.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0078"> That same morning, I dismantled the house, pulling out the nails and moving it piece by piece to the pond's edge. I spread the boards on the grass to fade and bend in the sunlight. As I drove down the forest trail, an early thrush sang a couple notes to me. A young Irish lad named Patrick sneakily told me that while I was hauling, neighbor Seeley pocketed the still-good, straight, usable nails and spikes. Then he stood there when I returned, casually passing time and appearing carefree, his mind on springtime, despite the destruction. Work was scarce, he claimed. He was there as a spectator, helping make this seemingly small event as significant as the fall of Troy. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0079">I have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen long, and eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large window on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace opposite. The exact cost of my house, paying the usual price for such materials as I used, but not counting the work, all of which was done by myself, was as follows; and I give the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses cost, and fewer still, if any, the separate cost of the various materials which compose them:—</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0079"> I dug my cellar on the side of a hill facing south, where a groundhog had previously made his den. I went down through the roots of sumac and blackberry bushes, past the lowest traces of plant life, making a space six feet by seven feet and just as deep, until I hit a layer of fine sand where potatoes could survive the coldest winter. The walls were angled but not lined with stone, yet the sand held its place as the sun had never touched it. The job only took two hours. I found special joy in breaking this ground, as nearly everywhere people dig into the earth seeking a steady temperature. Beneath the grandest mansion in the city, you'll still find the cellar where they keep their roots like in olden times. Long after the house above has vanished, future generations will notice the imprint it left in the soil. A house is really just a kind of entryway to an underground burrow. </p>

No one was ever more honored by their house raisers than I was. I hope they will help raise even greater structures someday. I started living in my house on July 4, as soon as the boards were up and the roof was on. The boards were carefully overlapped to keep out the rain. But before putting up the boards, I built the base of a chimney at one end, carrying stones from the pond up the hill in my arms. I finished building the chimney in the fall after I was done hoeing, before I needed a fire for heat. In the meantime, I cooked outdoors on the ground, early in the morning, which I still think is better in some ways than the usual method. When it stormed before my bread was done, I put up some boards over the fire and sat under them to watch the loaf, spending some nice hours that way. Back then, when I was working a lot with my hands, I didn't read much. But even the smallest bits of paper on the ground, my placemat, or tablecloth, entertained me as much as reading the Iliad. </p>

                        <p class="receipt-item transformed-text" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0081"> It would be worthwhile to build even more carefully than I did, considering, for example, what role a door, window, cellar, or attic plays in human nature. Perhaps we should not build anything more until we have a better reason for it than just our current needs. There is a certain appropriateness in a man building his own house, similar to a bird building its own nest. Who knows, if people built their own homes and provided food for their families in a simple and honest way, maybe the poetic instinct would develop in everyone, just as all birds sing when they are busy with these tasks? But unfortunately, we are like cowbirds and cuckoos that lay their eggs in nests built by other birds, and we don't cheer travelers with our noisy and unmelodic calls. Should we always leave the joy of building to carpenters? What does architecture mean in most people's lives? In all my walks, I never met anyone engaged in the simple and natural work of building their own house. We are part of the community. It's not just the tailor who is a ninth of a person; the same goes for the preacher, the merchant, and the farmer. Where will this division of labor end, and what purpose does it ultimately serve? Undoubtedly, someone else <i class="calibre3">may </i>think for me, but that doesn't mean I want them to do all my thinking for me. </p>

The focus is on putting truth within the ornaments, like an almond or caraway seed in every sugar plum, though almonds are healthier without sugar. The real question is how the inhabitant can build truthfully inside and out, letting the ornaments take care of themselves. No reasonable person thinks ornaments are merely superficial, like a tortoise's spotted shell or a shellfish's mother-of-pearl tints. A man has no more control over his house's architectural style than a tortoise over its shell, and a soldier need not try to paint his virtue's color on his flag.

Many architectural ornaments are hollow and would be stripped off by a September gale, like borrowed plumes, without harming the essentials. Those without olives or wines in the cellar can do without architecture. What if equal fuss were made about literary style, with bible architects spending as much time on cornices as church architects? Thus are made belles-lettres, beaux-arts, and their professors. It matters little how sticks are slanted over or under a man, and what colors are painted on his box. It would mean something if he earnestly slanted and painted them himself, but when the spirit has left the tenant, it's like constructing his own coffin—the architecture of the grave, with "carpenter" meaning "coffin-maker". In despair or indifference to life, a man might say to paint your house the color of dirt at your feet. Is he thinking of his final resting place? Might as well flip a coin for it.

If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity rather than for myself; and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement. Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy,—chaff which I find it difficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any man,—I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil’s attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the mere rent of a student’s room, which is only a little larger than my own, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its extreme, a principle which should never be followed but with circumspection,—to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I think that it would be <i>better than this</i>, for the students, or those who desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful. “But,  says one, “you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?  I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not <i>play</i> life, or <i>study</i> it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly <i>live</i> it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where any thing is professed and practised but the art of life;—to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month,—the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this,—or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the mean while, and had received a Rodgers’ penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied navigation!—why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the <i>poor</i> student studies and is taught only <i>political</i> economy, while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.</p>

They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but when he was presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand, had nothing to say.

The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents. That is almost a day’s wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the mean while have earned your fare, and arrive there some time to-morrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day.

To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts “All aboard!  when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are run over,—and it will be called, and will be, “A melancholy accident.  No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of one’s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it, reminds me of the Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. “What!  exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land, “is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?  Yes, I answer <i>comparatively</i> good, that is, you might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.</p>

The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was “good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on.  I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in ploughing, which supplied me with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the ploughing, though I held the plough myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work, &amp;c., $14.72½. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn.

            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0115"> I discovered that a student who wants a place to live can get one for life at a cost no higher than the rent they currently pay each year. If I seem to brag too much, my excuse is that I boast for humanity, not myself. My flaws and inconsistencies don't change the fact that what I'm saying is true. Despite a lot of hypocrisy and nonsense, which I find hard to separate from the truth, but which I regret as much as anyone, I will speak freely and be myself in this regard. It's such a relief to both my mind and body, and I'm determined not to let humility turn me into the devil's advocate. I'll try to put in a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College, just renting a student's room, which is only slightly bigger than mine, costs thirty dollars a year. This is even though the college had the benefit of building thirty-two rooms side by side under one roof. The student has to deal with the inconvenience of many noisy neighbors and maybe living on the fourth floor. I can't help but think that if we were wiser about these things, not only would less education be needed, because more would have already been gained, but the money spent on getting an education would largely disappear. The conveniences a student needs at Cambridge or elsewhere cost them or someone else ten times the sacrifice of life they would with proper management on both sides. The things that cost the most are never what the student really wants. Tuition, for example, is a big part of the bill, while the far more valuable education gained from interacting with the most cultured peers is free. The way a college is usually founded is by getting people to donate money. Then, blindly following the principle of division of labor to the extreme, which should only be done carefully, they hire a contractor who sees it as a chance to make money. The contractor then employs Irish workers or other laborers to actually lay the foundations, while the future students are said to be preparing themselves for it. Successive generations have to pay for these oversights. I think it would be better for the students, or those who want to benefit from it, to lay the foundation themselves. The student who gets their desired free time and seclusion by systematically avoiding any work necessary for a person only gains an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, cheating themselves out of the experience that alone can make leisure fruitful. "But," someone might say, "you don't mean the students should work with their hands instead of their heads?" That's not exactly what I mean, but I mean something they might consider quite similar. I mean they shouldn't just play at life, or merely study it, while society supports them in this expensive game. Instead, they should earnestly live it from start to finish. How could young people better learn to live than by immediately trying the experiment of living? I think this would exercise their minds as much as math. If I wanted a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I wouldn't do what's commonly done. I wouldn't just send him to some professor, where anything is professed and practiced except the art of life. I wouldn't have him survey the world only through a telescope or microscope and never with his own eyes. I wouldn't have him study chemistry without learning how his bread is made, or mechanics without learning how it's earned. I wouldn't have him discover new moons of Neptune but not see the specks in his own eyes, or to what aimless person he is a moon himself. I wouldn't have him be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him while pondering the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Who would have advanced more at the end of a month—the boy who made his own pocket knife from ore he dug up and smelted, reading only as much as needed for this, or the boy who attended lectures on metallurgy at the Institute meanwhile and got a store-bought knife from his father? Which one would more likely cut his fingers?... To my surprise, I was told upon leaving college that I had studied navigation! Why, if I had taken one trip down the harbor I would have known more about it. Even the poor student only studies political economy, while the economy of living, which is the same as philosophy, isn't even sincerely taught in our colleges.

Our inventions tend to be cute toys that take our focus away from important matters. They are just better ways to reach an unimproved goal that was already too easy to get to, like how trains go to Boston or New York. We rush to build a telegraph from Maine to Texas, but those states may have nothing crucial to share. It's like a man eager to meet a famous deaf woman, but when handed her ear trumpet, has nothing to say. As if talking fast matters more than talking wisely. We can't wait to tunnel under the Atlantic to bring the old world closer to the new. But the first news to reach American ears might be that Princess Adelaide has a cough.

I desire to speak impartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or failure of the present economical and social arrangements. I was more independent than any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius, which is a very crooked one, every moment. Beside being better off than they already, if my house had been burned or my crops had failed, I should have been nearly as well off as before.</p>

I told my friend, "Let's see who gets there first." It's thirty miles and costs ninety cents—nearly a full day's pay. I recall when workers on this same road only made sixty cents a day. Well, if I leave now by foot, I'll arrive before nightfall; I've traveled at that speed for weeks at a time. Meanwhile, you'll work to earn your fare and get there tomorrow, or maybe tonight if you're fortunate enough to find work quickly. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you'll spend most of the day working here. So even if the railroad circled the globe, I believe I would stay ahead of you. And as for seeing the country and gaining that type of experience, I would have to stop being your friend entirely. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0118">I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen exchange work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying, and it is no boy’s play. Certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However <i>I</i> should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a herds-man merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we certain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss, and that the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted that some public works would not have been constructed without this aid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only works for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn overshadows the house. This town is said to have the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county. It should not be by their architecture, but why not even by their power of abstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone. Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I love better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar grandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man’s field than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build splendid temples; but what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I might possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it. As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson&amp; Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the West and the East,—to know who built them. For my part, I should like to know who in those days did not build them,—who were above such trifling. But to proceed with my statistics.</p>

Making a global railroad accessible to everyone is like leveling the entire planet's surface. People have a vague idea that if they keep up this joint stock and digging activity long enough, everyone will eventually ride somewhere quickly and for free. But even when a crowd rushes to the station and the conductor yells, "All aboard!" once the smoke clears, it becomes obvious that only a few are actually riding while the rest have been run over—and it will be called a "tragic accident". Surely those who have earned their ticket can ride, if they live that long, but by then they'll likely have lost their flexibility and wanderlust. Spending the prime of one's life making money just to enjoy some dubious freedom in the least valuable years reminds me of the Englishman who went to India to make his fortune first so he could return home to live as a poet. He should've just gone straight to the attic. "What!" cry a million Irishmen popping up from shacks across the country, "Isn't this railroad we built a good thing?"

I dug up all the land I needed, about a third of an acre. From my two years of experience, I learned that if you live simply, eat only what you grow, and don't trade it for pricier, fancier items, you only need to farm a small plot. It's cheaper to dig it by hand than plow with oxen, and better to rotate to fresh soil than fertilize the old. You can do all the needed farm work on the side in summer, without relying on animals. I want to speak fairly on this, as someone not invested in the current economic and social systems. I was more independent than any farmer in Concord, since I wasn't tied to a house or farm. I could follow my own path at any moment. Besides being better off than them already, if my house burned down or my crops failed, I would have been almost as well off as before. </p>

                    <p class="receipt-item transformed-text" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0123"> I tend to believe that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men, the former being much freer. Men and oxen trade labor, but if we only consider essential work, the oxen have a significant advantage with their much larger farm. Man does his part of the exchange in his six weeks of haying, which is no easy task. Surely no nation living simply in all ways, that is, no nation of thinkers, would make the great mistake of using animal labor. It's true there has never been and likely won't soon be a nation of philosophers, and I'm not sure it's even desirable. However, I would have never trained a horse or bull to work for me, for fear of merely becoming a horseman or herdsman. If society seems to benefit from this, are we sure one man's gain isn't another's loss, and that the stable boy is as satisfied as his master? Even if some public works required this help, letting man share the glory with beasts, couldn't he have still done even worthier things? When men start doing not just unnecessary or artistic work, but luxurious and idle work with animal aid, a few inevitably do all the exchange work with oxen, becoming slaves to the strongest. Man thus works not only for his inner animal, but as a symbol, for the outer one too. Though we have many sturdy brick or stone houses, a farmer's prosperity is still gauged by how much the barn dwarfs the house. This town supposedly has the biggest homes for livestock around, and doesn't lack in public buildings, yet has few halls for free worship or speech in the county. Nations should seek to commemorate themselves not by architecture, but by their power of abstract thought. How much more admirable is the Bhagavad Gita than all the East's ruins! Towers and temples are the domain of princes. A simple, independent mind doesn't toil at any prince's command. Genius isn't beholden to any emperor, nor is its material silver, gold, or marble, except trivially. To what end is so much stone hammered, I ask? In Arcadia, I saw no stone hammering. Nations are gripped by a mad ambition to perpetuate their memory by the amount of hammered stone they leave behind. What if equal effort went to refining their manners? One bit of good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I prefer seeing stones in their place. Thebes' grandeur was a vulgar one. A stone wall bounding an honest man's field makes more sense than hundred-gated Thebes that strayed further from life's true purpose. Barbaric, heathen religion and civilization build splendid temples, but what you might call Christianity does not. Most stone a nation hammers goes only toward its tomb. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, the most wondrous fact is that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives building a tomb for some ambitious fool, whom it would've been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile and fed to the dogs. I might make some excuse for them and him, but I don’t have the time. As for the builders' religion and love of art, it's much the same worldwide, whether it's an Egyptian temple or the U.S. Bank. It costs more than it's worth. The driving force is vanity, helped by love of garlic, bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and Dobson &amp; Sons the stonecutters get the job. When thirty centuries start looking down on it, mankind starts looking up at it. As for your high towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow here once who tried to dig through to China, and got so far that he claimed to hear the Chinese pots and kettles rattle, but I shan't go out of my way to admire the hole he made. Many care about who built the monuments of the West and East. I'd like to know who in those days didn't build them, who were above such trifles. But let me proceed with my statistics. </p>

Nothing was given me of which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a week. It was, for nearly two years after this, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork, molasses, and salt, and my drink water. It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I may as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and I trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a comparative statement like this.</p>

I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on several accounts, simply off a dish of purslane ( <i>Portulaca oleracea</i> )which I gathered in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin on account of the savoriness of the trivial name. And pray what more can a reasonable man desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green sweet-corn boiled, with the addition of salt? Even the little variety which I used was a yielding to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have come to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries, but for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took to drinking water only.</p>

            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0174">Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber sawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to “good, sweet, wholesome bread,  the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the <i>spiritus</i> which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire,—some precious bottle-full, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land,—this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable,—for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process,—and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. “Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquæ paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu.  Which I take to mean—“Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover,  that is, in a baking-kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.</p>

Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any. For the most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing, and buys flour, which is at least no more wholesome, at a greater cost, at the store. I saw that I could easily raise my bushel or two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow on the poorest land, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them in a hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some concentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good molasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to set out a few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these were growing I could use various substitutes beside those which I have named. “For,  as the Forefathers sang,—</p>

I've accounted for everything I was given. Based on the estimate above, my weekly food costs were around twenty-seven cents. For nearly two years after this, I ate rye and cornmeal without yeast, potatoes, rice, very little salt pork, molasses, salt, and drank water. As someone who greatly admired Indian philosophy, it was fitting that I mainly lived on rice. To address the concerns of some persistent critics, I'll note that when I occasionally ate out, as I always had and hope to continue doing, it often negatively impacted my household routines. However, since dining out was a constant factor, as mentioned, it doesn't affect a comparative analysis like this one. </p>

A person can eat as simply as animals do and still be healthy and strong. I've made satisfying meals, in many ways, from just a dish of purslane (a common weed) that I picked in my cornfield, boiled, and salted. I use the Latin name because the common name sounds so good. And really, what more could a sensible person want on a typical day in times of peace than enough ears of green sweet corn, boiled with a bit of salt? Even the small amount of variety I had was more about satisfying my tastes than my health. Yet people have reached a point where they often go hungry, not because they lack basic needs, but because they want luxuries. I even know a good woman who believes her son died because he started drinking only water. </p>

The pantaloons which I now wear were woven in a farmer’s family,—thank Heaven there is so much virtue still in man; for I think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and memorable as that from the man to the farmer;—and in a new country, fuel is an encumbrance. As for a habitat, if I were not permitted still to squat, I might purchase one acre at the same price for which the land I cultivated was sold—namely, eight dollars and eight cents. But as it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the land by squatting on it.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0179"> At first, I made bread using only cornmeal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes that I baked on a shingle or a piece of wood in front of my outdoor fire. However, it often got smoky and had a pine-like taste. I also tried using flour, but eventually found a mix of rye and cornmeal to be the most suitable and tasty. In cold weather, baking several small loaves one after another was quite entertaining, carefully watching and flipping them like an Egyptian incubating eggs. These real cereal fruits that I ripened had a wonderful aroma like other fine fruits, which I preserved as long as possible by wrapping them in cloth. I studied the essential ancient art of bread-making, looking at available sources, going back to the earliest days and the invention of unleavened bread, when people first moved from the wildness of nuts and meat to the gentleness and sophistication of this food. I progressed in my studies through the accidental souring of dough that likely taught leavening, and the various later fermentations, until I arrived at "good, sweet, wholesome bread," life's staple. Leaven, considered by some to be bread's soul—the spirit filling its cellular structure, religiously preserved like the vestal flame—I suppose some precious bottleful first brought over on the Mayflower did the job for America. Its influence continues to rise, swell, and spread in cereal waves across the country. I regularly and faithfully got this starter from the village, until one morning I forgot the rules and scalded my yeast. Through this mistake, I found that even this was not essential—my discoveries came through analysis rather than synthesis. I have happily left it out since, despite most housewives insisting that safe and wholesome bread could not be made without yeast, and older folks predicting a quick decline of vital forces. Yet I find it is not a necessary ingredient, and after going a year without it, I am still alive. I am glad to avoid the silliness of carrying a bottle in my pocket, which would sometimes pop open and spill its contents to my embarrassment. It is easier and more respectable to omit it. Humans are animals who can adapt to all climates and situations better than any other. I also did not add any baking soda or other acid or alkali to my bread. It seems I made it according to the recipe Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. His original words were: “Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato.

If they cannot understand that, they cannot understand much that I have to say. For my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his teeth for all mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human race is interested in these experiments, though a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or who own their thirds in mills, may be alarmed.</p>

None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding’s furniture. I could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called rich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we <i>move</i> ever but to get rid of our furniture, our <i>exuviæ</i> ; at last to go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man’s belt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them,—dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a dead set! “Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?  If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his “furniture,  as whether it is insured or not. “But what shall I do with my furniture?  My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider’s web then. Even those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody’s barn. I look upon England to-day as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk, bandbox and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck—I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all <i>that</i> to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to put one’s paw into it.</p>

In a new land, fuel is a burden. If I wasn't allowed to keep living on the land, I could buy one acre for the same price that the land I farmed was sold for—eight dollars and eight cents.

Would it not be well if we were to celebrate such a “busk,  or “feast of first fruits,  as Bartram describes to have been the custom of the Mucclasse Indians? “When a town celebrates the busk,  says he, “having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture, they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their filth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap, and consume it with fire. After having taken medicine, and fasted for three days, all the fire in the town is extinguished. During this fast they abstain from the gratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty is proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.— </p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0186"> My furniture, some of which I made myself while the rest cost me nothing that I haven't already accounted for, included a bed, table, desk, three chairs, a small mirror, tongs, andirons, a kettle, skillet, frying pan, dipper, wash bowl, two knives, forks, three plates, a cup, spoon, oil jug, molasses jug, and a lamp. Nobody is so poor that they must sit on a pumpkin out of laziness. There are plenty of chairs in village attics that I prefer, free for the taking. Furniture! Thank God I can sit and stand without help from a furniture store. What man besides a philosopher wouldn't be ashamed to see his belongings in a cart going up the country, visible to all, a pathetic load of empty boxes? That's Spaulding's furniture. I could never tell if such a load belonged to a rich man or poor one; the owner always seemed impoverished. The more you have, the poorer you are. Each load looks like a dozen shanties' contents, and if one shanty is poor, this is twelve times poorer. We only move to get rid of furniture and belongings, to leave this world for a newly furnished one, abandoning the old to burn. It's as if these possessions are strapped to a man, and he can't travel the rough terrain where we live without dragging this trap. The lucky fox left his tail in the trap. A muskrat will chew off his leg to be free. No wonder man has lost flexibility. How often is he stuck! "Sir, what do you mean by stuck?" If you're a seer, when you meet a man you'll see all he owns behind him, even his kitchen items and junk he won't burn, and he'll seem harnessed to it, trudging along. The man is stuck who has squeezed through a hole his furniture cannot follow. I feel for the put-together man, seemingly free, who speaks of whether his "furniture" is insured. "But what about my furniture?" My bright butterfly is caught in a spider's web. Even those without furniture for a while usually have some stored away. I see England as an old man traveling with too much baggage from long housekeeping that he lacks courage to burn. Toss the largest trunks at least! A well man today would struggle to pick up his bed and walk; a sick one should lay it down and run. I've pitied immigrants teetering under a bundle holding their all, looking like a growth on their neck, not because it was everything, but because they had to carry it all. If I must drag a trap, I'll keep it light and not let it pinch anything vital. But maybe it's wisest to never stick a paw in one. </p>

If the sun gets too friendly at times, I find it more efficient to hide behind a natural curtain than to add another chore to my housekeeping list.

Among the items was a dried tapeworm. Now, after being stored in his attic and other dusty places for 50 years, these things weren't destroyed. Instead of burning them in a cleansing fire, they were auctioned off, increasing their number. The neighbors eagerly gathered to see them, bought them all, and carefully moved them to their own attics and storage spaces. There they'll remain until their estates are settled, when the cycle will begin again. When a person dies, they stir up the dust. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0191">For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study. I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the good of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have tried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way in that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I was actually afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a good business. When formerly I was looking about to see what I could do for a living, some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its small profits might suffice,—for my greatest skill has been to want but little,—so little capital it required, so little distraction from my wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated this occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick the berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of them; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might gather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods, even to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I have since learned that trade curses everything it handles; and though you trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to the business.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0191"> Some savage nations have customs that we might benefit from imitating. They at least go through the motions of shedding their old ways each year. They have the concept, even if they don't fully put it into practice. It might be good for us to hold a "busk" or "feast of first fruits" like the Mucclasse Indians did, according to Bartram.  “When a town celebrates the busk,  he says, “having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture, they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their filth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap, and consume it with fire.

If there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things, and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are “industrious,  and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as hard as they do,—work till they pay for themselves, and get their free papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one. The laborer’s day ends with the going down of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the other.</p>

I would not have any one adopt <i>my</i> mode of living on any account; for, beside that before he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue <i>his own</i> way, and not his father’s or his mother’s or his neighbor’s instead. The youth may build or plant or sail, only let him not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like to do. It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our port within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.</p>

But for my part, I preferred the solitary dwelling. Moreover, it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall; and when you have done this, the common partition, to be much cheaper, must be a thin one, and that other may prove a bad neighbor, and also not keep his side in repair. The only coöperation which is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little true coöperation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible to men. If a man has faith, he will coöperate with equal faith everywhere; if he has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever company he is joined to. To coöperate, in the highest as well as the lowest sense, means to get our living together. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel together over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he went, before the mast and behind the plow, the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could not long be companions or coöperate, since one would not <i>operate</i> at all. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0195"> I've rarely come across a more genuine sacrament, which the dictionary defines as an “outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace,  I firmly believe they were originally inspired by Heaven to act in this way, even though there's no biblical record of this revelation.<br class="calibre4" />  </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0196">But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I confess that I have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises. I have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also. There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do,—for the devil finds employment for the idle,—I might try my hand at some such pastime as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this respect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain myself, and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor. While my townsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their fellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to other and less humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as for any thing else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are full. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me, to save the universe from annihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not stand between any man and his genius; and to him who does this work, which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I would say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most likely they will.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0196"> For over five years, I supported myself solely through manual labor. I discovered that by working about six weeks per year, I could cover all my living expenses. This gave me my winters and most of my summers free for studying. I tried teaching school but found my expenses were disproportionate to my income, as I had to dress, act, and even think a certain way, which was a waste of my time. Since I taught only for a paycheck and not to benefit others, it was unsuccessful. I also attempted business but realized it would take a decade to get established, by which time I'd likely be morally corrupt. I feared I might even be running a profitable business by then. When I previously considered ways to make a living, with the pressure of conforming to others' expectations weighing on me, I seriously contemplated picking huckleberries. I foolishly thought I could manage that with its meager profits, as I was skilled at needing very little. It required minimal capital and distraction from my usual ways. While my peers confidently entered trades or professions, I viewed berry-picking as most similar, roaming the hills all summer to gather the berries I encountered and then casually selling them, like tending to Admetus' flocks. I also imagined gathering wild herbs or delivering evergreen boughs to villagers, even to the city by the hay-cart load, for those who appreciated reminders of the forest. However, I have since discovered that business taints everything it touches, and even if you trade in heavenly messages, you're still cursed by the business world. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0197">I am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many of my readers would make a similar defence. At doing something,—I will not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good,—I do not hesitate to say that I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it is for my employer to find out. What <i>good</i> I do, in the common sense of that word, must be aside from my main path, and for the most part wholly unintended. Men say, practically, Begin where you are and such as you are, without aiming mainly to become of more worth, and with kindness aforethought go about doing good. If I were to preach at all in this strain, I should say rather, Set about being good. As if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin Goodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and tainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily increasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can look him in the face, and then, and in the mean while too, going about the world in his own orbit, doing it good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has discovered, the world going about him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had the sun’s chariot but one day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun, through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0197"> As I valued certain things more than others, especially my freedom, and could manage with little yet still do well, I had no desire to spend my time earning fancy carpets, fine furniture, gourmet food, or a Greek or Gothic style house at that point. If there are those who can acquire such things without disruption and know how to use them, I leave that pursuit to them. Some are "hard-working" and seem to enjoy labor for its own sake, or maybe because it keeps them from worse trouble; I have nothing to say to them right now. To those who wouldn't know what to do with extra free time, I might suggest working twice as much until they pay for themselves and gain their freedom. I discovered that working as a day laborer was the most independent job, needing only thirty to forty days per year to get by. The laborer's day finishes at sunset, freeing him to pursue his passions, while his employer, who plans month to month, has no break all year long. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0198">There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me,—some of its virus mingled with my blood. No,—in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way. A man is not a good <i>man</i> to me because he will feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or pull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland dog that will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one’s fellow-man in the broadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man in his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what are a hundred Howards to <i>us</i>, if their philanthropy do not help <i>us</i> in our best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me, or the like of me.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0198"> In summary, I believe, through both conviction and practice, that sustaining oneself in this world is not a struggle but a hobby, if one lives plainly and sensibly; much like the activities of less developed societies are still considered pastimes by more technologically advanced ones. A person does not need to toil and labor to make a living, unless they find manual work more effortless than I do. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0199">The Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the stake, suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being superior to physical suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation which the missionaries could offer; and the law to do as you would be done by fell with less persuasiveness on the ears of those who, for their part, did not care how they were done by, who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and came very near freely forgiving them all they did.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0199"> One young man I know, who has inherited some land, told me he would live like I do if he could. I wouldn't want anyone to adopt my lifestyle for any reason. Besides, before he has truly mastered it, I may have discovered a new way for myself. I want there to be as many unique individuals in the world as possible. But I would have each person carefully discover and follow their own path, not their father's, mother's or neighbor's. The young person may build, plant or sail, but let him not be stopped from doing what he says he wants to do. It is by a single point that we gain wisdom, like how the sailor or escaped slave fixes their eye on the North Star. But that is enough to guide us through life. We may not reach our destination in a predictable time, but we must maintain the right course. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0200">Be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one bitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is true, and that he could afford to refuse the <i>extra</i> garments which I offered him, he had so many <i>intra</i> ones. This ducking was the very thing he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday’s liberty for the rest. Some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of justice?</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0200"> Certainly, what is true for one is even more true for a thousand, as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one. One roof can cover, one cellar can underlie, and one wall can separate several apartments. But I personally preferred a solitary dwelling. Besides, it's usually cheaper to build everything yourself than to convince someone else of the benefits of a shared wall. And even then, for the shared partition to be much cheaper, it must be thin, and the neighbor may turn out to be bad and not maintain their side. The only cooperation that is usually possible is extremely limited and superficial. And the little true cooperation that exists is as if it doesn't, being a harmony that people can't hear. If someone has faith, they will cooperate with equal faith everywhere. If they don't have faith, they will keep living like everyone else, no matter who they associate with. To cooperate, in the highest and lowest sense, means to make a living together. I recently heard a proposal for two young men to travel the world together, one without money, earning his way as he went, working on ships and farms, while the other carried a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was clear they could not be companions or cooperate for long, since one would not work at all. They would separate at the first interesting point in their adventures. Most importantly, as I have suggested, the man who goes alone can leave today, but he who travels with another must wait until the other is ready, and it may be a long time before they depart. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0201">Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he was kind to the poor; meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I once heard a reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary, and political worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England’s best men and women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0201"> But all of this is very selfish, some of my neighbors have said. I admit that until now, I've taken part in very few charitable projects. I've made some sacrifices out of a sense of duty, and among those, I've given up this pleasure too. There are people who have used every trick to convince me to support a poor family in town; and if I had nothing else to do—since the devil makes work for idle hands—I might try my hand at a hobby like that. However, when I've thought about treating myself in this way, and putting Heaven in my debt by keeping certain poor people as comfortable as I keep myself, and have even gone so far as to make them the offer, they have each and every one of them, without hesitation, chosen to stay poor. While my fellow townspeople devote themselves in so many ways to the good of others, I hope that at least one person can be spared for other, less compassionate activities. You need to have a talent for charity, just like anything else. As for doing good, that's one of the professions that are already full. What's more, I've tried it honestly, and, strange as it may seem, I'm convinced that it doesn't suit me. I probably wouldn't knowingly and deliberately abandon my particular calling to do the good that society asks of me, even to save the universe from destruction; and I believe that a similar but infinitely greater commitment elsewhere is all that's keeping it going now. But I wouldn't stand in the way of any man and his calling; and to the person who does this work that I'm turning down, with all his heart and soul and life, I would say: Keep going, even if the world calls it doing evil, as they most likely will. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0202">I would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind. I do not value chiefly a man’s uprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his stem and leaves. Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for the sick, serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance be wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His goodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity, which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and ease, and not our disease, and take care that this does not spread by contagion. From what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing? Under what latitudes reside the heathen to whom we would send light? Who is that intemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem? If any thing ail a man, so that he does not perform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels even,—for that is the seat of sympathy,—he forthwith sets about reforming—the world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it is a true discovery, and he is the man to make it,—that the world has been eating green apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will nibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out the Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous Indian and Chinese villages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic activity, the powers in the mean while using him for their own ends, no doubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be ripe, and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome to live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have committed. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0202"> I'm not saying my situation is unique; many readers would likely make a similar argument. When it comes to doing something—I won't claim my neighbors will call it good—I'll readily admit I'd be a great person to hire. But it's up to my employer to figure out what that "something" is. Any good I do, in the typical sense, is probably unintentional and separate from my primary path. People essentially say, "Start where you are, as you are, without mainly trying to improve yourself, and deliberately go out and do good". If I were to preach like this, I'd say, "Focus on being good". It's as if the sun should stop once it reaches the brightness of the moon or a sixth-magnitude star, and wander around like Robin Goodfellow, peeking in windows, driving people mad, spoiling food, and illuminating the darkness, rather than steadily growing in warmth and positivity until it's too bright to look at directly. Meanwhile, it orbits the world, doing good, or as modern thinking suggests, the world orbits it, benefiting from its presence. When Phaeton tried to prove his divine heritage through good deeds, he steered the sun's chariot off course for a day, burning heavenly houses, scorching the earth, drying up springs, and creating the Sahara Desert. Finally, Jupiter struck him down with a thunderbolt, and the grieving sun didn't shine for a year. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0203">I believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his fellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is his private ail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the morning rise over his couch, and he will forsake his generous companions without apology. My excuse for not lecturing against the use of tobacco is, that I never chewed it; that is a penalty which reformed tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are things enough I have chewed, which I could lecture against. If you should ever be betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning and tie your shoe-strings. Take your time, and set about some free labor.</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0203"> No smell is worse than the odor of spoiled goodness. It's human, it's godly, it's rotten meat. If I knew for sure that someone was visiting me just to do me good, I'd run for my life. It would be like that dry, scorching desert wind in Africa called the simoom that fills you with dust until you suffocate. I'd be afraid of catching some of his goodness, like a disease in my blood. No, I'd rather face evil the normal way. A man isn't good to me just because he'd feed me if I was starving, warm me if I was freezing, or rescue me if I fell in a ditch. You could find a Newfoundland dog to do that much. Philanthropy isn't the same as loving all people. Howard was surely a very kind and admirable man, and he has his reward. But what good are a hundred Howards to us if their charity doesn't help us when we're at our best and most deserving of aid? I've never heard of a philanthropic meeting that sincerely aimed to do any good for me or others like me. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0204">Our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our hymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him forever. One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere recorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life, any memorable praise of God. All health and success does me good, however far off and withdrawn it may appear; all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does me evil, however much sympathy it may have with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed restore mankind by truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over our own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world.</p>

Being able to endure physical suffering, these Native Americans were sometimes beyond any comfort the missionaries could provide. The principle of treating others as you want to be treated was less convincing to those who didn't mind how they were treated. They loved their enemies in a strange way and almost forgave them for everything they did. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0205">I read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that “They asked a wise man, saying; Of the many celebrated trees which the Most High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or free, excepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is there in this? He replied; Each has its appropriate produce, and appointed season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and during their absence dry and withered; to neither of which states is the cypress exposed, being always flourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious independents.—Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory; for the Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue to flow through Bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct: if thy hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if it affords nothing to give away, be an azad, or free man, like the cypress. </p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0205"> Make sure you provide the poor with the assistance they require most, even if your example leaves them behind. If you give money, invest yourself in it, and don't just leave it to them. We sometimes make odd errors. Often the poor man isn't as cold and hungry as he is dirty, ragged, and crude. It's partly his preference, not just his bad luck. If you give him money, he might use it to buy more rags. I used to feel sorry for the awkward Irish workers who cut ice on the pond, dressed in such poor and tattered clothes, while I shivered in my neater and somewhat more stylish outfit. Then one freezing day, a man who had fallen into the water came to my house to warm up. I watched him remove three pairs of pants and two pairs of socks before he got to his skin, although they were quite dirty and ragged. He could afford to refuse the extra clothes I offered him since he had so many layers. This dip in the water was exactly what he needed. Then I started pitying myself, realizing it would be a greater kindness to give me a flannel shirt than to give him a whole thrift store. There are a thousand people chopping at the branches of evil for every one striking at the root. The person who devotes the most time and money to the needy may be doing the most by their way of life to create the misery they try in vain to alleviate. It's like the pious slave-breeder using the proceeds from every tenth slave to buy a Sunday's freedom for the rest. Some show kindness to the poor by hiring them in their kitchens. Wouldn't it be kinder if they employed themselves there? You brag about spending a tenth of your income on charity; perhaps you should spend the other nine-tenths that way and be done with it. Society only recovers a tenth of the property. Is this due to the generosity of the one who possesses it or the negligence of the officers of justice? </p>

            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0206"> Philanthrop<span id="id_4bewzdj" class="calibre5">y</span> is nearly the only virtue that is adequately valued by people. In fact, it is vastly overvalued, and it is our self-interest that inflates its worth. One bright day here in Concord, a strong poor man praised a fellow citizen to me because, as he put it, he was good to the poor, referring to himself. The kind uncles and aunts of humanity are more appreciated than its true spiritual mothers and fathers. I once heard a respected speaker on England, an educated and smart man, list her scientific, literary, and political greats like Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others, and then speak of her Christian heroes, whom he put on a much higher pedestal than the rest, likely due to his profession. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Everyone must sense the dishonesty and hypocrisy in this. The latter were not England's finest people, only, perhaps, her top philanthropists. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0207"><b> <i>The Pretensions of Poverty</i> </b></p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0207"> I wouldn't take away from the praise owed to philanthropy, but simply ask for fairness for all who bless humanity with their lives and deeds. I don't mainly value a person's integrity and kindness, which are like their stem and leaves. The plants whose dried greenness we use for medicinal tea play a modest role, mostly by quacks. I desire the blossom and fruit of a person; that some aroma and ripeness enhance our interactions. Their goodness shouldn't be a limited, fleeting act, but a steady excess that costs nothing and goes unnoticed. This charity conceals many sins. Too often, philanthropists surround people with their own discarded sorrows, calling it empathy. We ought to share our strength and health, not our despair and sickness, ensuring it doesn't spread. Where do the cries of anguish come from? Where are the unbelievers we'd enlighten? Who is that unrestrained, savage man we'd save? If anything troubles someone so they can't function, even a stomach ache—the core of compassion—they start reforming the world. Being a microcosm, they find, rightly, that the world ate green apples; to them, Earth itself is a big green apple in awful danger of being nibbled by mankind before it ripens; their harsh philanthropy quickly embraces Inuits, Patagonians, and crowded Indian and Chinese towns; so, after some years of philanthropic work, no doubt used for others' purposes, they heal their indigestion, Earth gains a slight blush as if ripening, and life becomes sweet and healthy again. I never imagined any wrong greater than I've done. I never knew, and never will know, a worse person than myself. </p>
            <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0208">T. CAREW</p>
            <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0208"> I think what truly saddens the reformer is not his empathy for his suffering companions, but rather his own personal troubles, even if he is the most saintly man. Once his own issues are resolved and he feels renewed, he will abandon his noble friends without regret. My reason for not speaking out against tobacco use is that I've never used it myself; that's a price reformed tobacco users must pay, although there are plenty of other things I've consumed that I could argue against. If you ever find yourself caught up in such charitable causes, don't let your left hand know what your right is doing, as it's not worth mentioning. Save those who are drowning, then lace up your shoes. Take your time and pursue some volunteer work. </p>

Our songbooks echo with a harmonious denouncement of God while also accepting him eternally. It seems that even the wise messengers and saviors have focused more on easing people's worries than strengthening their optimism. There is no simple, wholehearted appreciation for the blessing of life or any notable praise for the divine to be found. All health and achievement benefits me, no matter how distant it may seem. In contrast, sickness and defeat sadden me and cause harm, regardless of how much understanding exists between myself and those conditions. Therefore, if we truly wish to revitalize humanity through natural, herbal, or spiritual means, we must first strive to be as pure and virtuous as nature itself. We need to clear away the gloom that hangs over our minds and infuse our beings with vitality. Rather than overseeing the less fortunate, we should aim to join the ranks of the most admirable in the world. </p>
