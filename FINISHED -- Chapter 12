      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002"><i>Hermit.</i> I wonder what the world is doing now. I have not heard so much as a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours. The pigeons are all asleep upon their roosts,—no flutter from them. Was that a farmer’s noon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now? The hands are coming in to boiled salt beef and cider and Indian bread. Why will men worry themselves so? He that does not eat need not work. I wonder how much they have reaped. Who would live there where a body can never think for the barking of Bose? And O, the housekeeping! to keep bright the devil’s door-knobs, and scour his tubs this bright day! Better not keep a house. Say, some hollow tree; and then for morning calls and dinner-parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. O, they swarm; the sun is too warm there; they are born too far into life for me. I have water from the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.—Hark! I hear a rustling of the leaves. Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to the instinct of the chase? or the lost pig which is said to be in these woods, whose tracks I saw after the rain? It comes on apace; my sumachs and sweet-briers tremble.—Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you? How do you like the world to-day?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"><i>Hermit.</i> I wonder what the world is up to now. I haven't heard a sound, not even a locust, over the sweet-fern for three hours. The pigeons are fast asleep on their roosts, without a flutter. Was that a farmer's noon horn I just heard from beyond the woods? The workers are coming in for salt beef, cider, and cornbread. Why do people worry so much? Those who don't eat, don't need to work. I wonder how much they've harvested. Who would want to live where you can never think due to Bose's barking? And oh, the housework! Polishing the devil's door knobs and scrubbing his tubs on this sunny day! It's better not to keep a house. Perhaps a hollow tree instead, and then morning visits and dinner parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. Oh, they're everywhere; it's too warm for them there; they're born too deep into life for my taste. I have water from the spring and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf. Listen! I hear the rustling of leaves. Is it some hungry village dog giving in to its hunting instincts? Or the lost pig said to be in these woods, whose tracks I saw after the rain? It's coming closer; my sumacs and sweet-briers are trembling. Well, if it isn't you, Mr. Poet! How are you finding the world today?</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003"><i>Poet.</i> See those clouds; how they hang! That’s the greatest thing I have seen to-day. There’s nothing like it in old paintings, nothing like it in foreign lands,—unless when we were off the coast of Spain. That’s a true Mediterranean sky. I thought, as I have my living to get, and have not eaten to-day, that I might go a-fishing. That’s the true industry for poets. It is the only trade I have learned. Come, let’s along.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003"><i>Poet.</i> Look at those clouds—the way they're suspended there! It's the most amazing sight I've seen today. You won't find anything like it in classical art or abroad, except maybe off the shores of Spain. Now that's what I call a genuine Mediterranean sky. I got to thinking, since I need to earn a living and haven't had a bite to eat yet, I could go fishing. It's the perfect job for a poet—the only trade I've truly mastered. So what do you say, let's head out!</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004"><i>Hermit.</i> I cannot resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I will go with you gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation. I think that I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while. But that we may not be delayed, you shall be digging the bait meanwhile. Angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these parts, where the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct. The sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish, when one’s appetite is not too keen; and this you may have all to yourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder among the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving. I think that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look well in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if you choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004"><i>Hermit.</i> I can't resist. My bread will be gone soon. I'll gladly go with you shortly, but I'm just finishing an important meditation. I think I'm almost done. So leave me be for a bit. But so we're not delayed, you can dig for bait in the meantime. Earthworms are hard to find here, where the soil lacks manure; they're nearly extinct. Digging for bait is almost as fun as catching the fish when you're not too hungry, and you can have that all to yourself today. I suggest digging over there in the ground-nuts, where the St John's wort is waving. I reckon you'll find one worm for every three shovelfuls of dirt you turn over, if you look carefully among the grass roots as if weeding. Or, if you want to go further, it's wise, as I've found the number of good bait increases nearly with the square of the distance.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005"><i>Hermit alone.</i> Let me see; where was I? Methinks I was nearly in this frame of mind; the world lay about at this angle. Shall I go to heaven or a-fishing? If I should soon bring this meditation to an end, would another so sweet occasion be likely to offer? I was as near being resolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my life. I fear my thoughts will not come back to me. If it would do any good, I would whistle for them. When they make us an offer, is it wise to say, We will think of it? My thoughts have left no track, and I cannot find the path again. What was it that I was thinking of? It was a very hazy day. I will just try these three sentences of Con-fut-see; they may fetch that state about again. I know not whether it was the dumps or a budding ecstasy. Mem. There never is but one opportunity of a kind.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">Hermit alone. Where was I? I think I was almost in this state of mind; the world seemed at this angle. Should I go to heaven or go fishing? If I end this thought soon, will another pleasant chance come? I was as close to understanding life's essence as I've ever been. I worry my thoughts won't return. If it helped, I'd whistle for them. When given an offer, is it smart to say, "We'll consider it"? My thoughts left no trace, and I can't find the way back. What was I pondering? The day was very hazy. I'll try these three Confucius sayings; they may bring back that feeling. I don't know if it was melancholy or budding joy. Remember, each opportunity is unique.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006"><i>Poet.</i> How now, Hermit, is it too soon? I have got just thirteen whole ones, beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will do for the smaller fry; they do not cover up the hook so much. Those village worms are quite too large; a shiner may make a meal off one without finding the skewer.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006"><i>Poet.</i> Is it too early? I only have thirteen complete worms, plus some small or damaged ones. But they'll work for the little fish since they won't hide the hook as much. The worms from town are way too big—a minnow could eat one and not even notice the hook!</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007"><i>Hermit.</i> Well, then, let’s be off. Shall we to the Concord? There’s good sport there if the water be not too high.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007"><i>Hermit.</i> Alright, let's head out. Should we go to the Concord River? The fishing is great there if the water level isn't too high.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">Why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has man just these species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice? I suspect that Pilpay &amp; Co. have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">Why do the things we see create our world? Why does humanity have these specific animals around us, as if only a mouse could live in that small crack? I think Pilpay and others have found the greatest purpose for animals, as they all carry a part of our ideas, in a way.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">The mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are said to have been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind not found in the village. I sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and it interested him much. When I was building, one of these had its nest underneath the house, and before I had laid the second floor, and swept out the shavings, would come out regularly at lunch time and pick up the crumbs at my feet. It probably had never seen a man before; and it soon became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my clothes. It could readily ascend the sides of the room by short impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in its motions. At length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my clothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner, while I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at bopeep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">The mice that infested my house were not the typical ones said to have been brought into the country, but a wild native species not seen in the village. I sent one to a well-known naturalist, who found it very intriguing. During construction, one of these mice had a nest under the house. Before I installed the second floor and cleared out the wood shavings, it would regularly emerge at lunchtime to eat crumbs at my feet. The mouse had likely never encountered a human before, but quickly grew accustomed to me, running over my shoes and up my clothes. It could easily climb the walls in short bursts, much like a squirrel, which it resembled in movement. One day, as I rested my elbow on a bench, the mouse scurried up my clothing, along my sleeve, and circled the paper holding my lunch. I kept the food close while the mouse and I played a game of hide-and-seek. Eventually, I held a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger, and the mouse nibbled on it while sitting in my hand. Afterward, it cleaned its face and paws like a fly before scampering off.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">A phœbe soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine which grew against the house. In June the partridge (<i>Tetrao umbellus</i>,) which is so shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from the woods in the rear to the front of my house, clucking and calling to them like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the woods. The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood. The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is. The young squat still and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother’s directions given from a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray themselves. You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a minute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are lost, for they never hear the mother’s call which gathers them again. These were my hens and chickens.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">A phœbe quickly nested in my shed, and for safety, a robin in a pine growing against the house. In June, the usually timid partridge (Tetrao umbellus) brought her chicks past my windows, from the back woods to the front yard, clucking like a hen and acting as a true forest mother. When you approach, the young instantly scatter at a signal from the mother, as if blown away by the wind. They blend in so well with the dry leaves and sticks that many hikers have nearly stepped on a brood, only noticing when the old bird flies off in a flurry of anxious calls and wing flapping to distract you. Sometimes the parent will tumble about before you in such disarray that it's hard to tell what she is at first. The chicks stay still and flat, often hiding their heads under leaves, only following distant commands from their mother. Even if you're looking right at them, it can take a minute to spot them. I've held them in my hand and their only focus, true to their instinct and mother, was to sit calmly with no fear or shaking. This instinct is so strong that once, after I put them back on the leaves and one fell over, ten minutes later it was in the same position as the others. Unlike most baby birds, they are well-developed and mature, more so than even chickens. Their clear, peaceful eyes have a remarkably grown-up yet innocent look that is unforgettable and full of wisdom. Those eyes weren't born with the bird, but are as old as the sky they mirror. The forest has no other treasure like it, and travelers rarely see such a pure sight. The foolish or thoughtless hunter often kills the parent, leaving the innocents to fall victim to a lurking animal or slowly blend in with the leaves they resemble. If hatched by a hen, they're said to scatter in alarm and get lost, never hearing their real mother's call. These were the hens and chicks in my woods.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister’s Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young pitch-pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the wood-cock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up their march, with faint wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the parent bird. There too the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">It's amazing how many animals live wild and free, yet hidden, in the woods, managing to survive near towns without being noticed by hunters. The otter, for example, can grow up to four feet long, the size of a small child, possibly without any person ever seeing it. I used to spot raccoons in the woods behind my house, and likely still heard their cries at night. Usually, I would rest for an hour or two at midday after planting, eat lunch, and read by a spring that fed a swamp and a brook trickling out from under Brister's Hill, a half-mile from my field. The path there wound through a series of descending grassy hollows filled with young pine trees, into a bigger forest surrounding the swamp. In a very isolated and shaded area, beneath a large white pine, there was still a clean, solid patch of grass to sit on. I had dug out the spring to create a well of clear gray water, where I could scoop up a bucket without disturbing it, and I went there for this almost daily in the middle of summer when the pond was at its warmest. The woodcock also brought her young one there to poke for worms in the mud. She flew just a foot above them down the bank as they scurried along below in a group. But eventually, after spotting me, she would abandon her chicks and fly in circles around me, closer and closer until just four or five feet away. She would fake a broken wing and leg to distract me and lead me away from her offspring, who would have already begun their trek through the swamp, peeping faintly and in a single line as she had instructed.Sometimes I heard the peeping of the young ones when I couldn't see the mother bird. The mourning doves also perched above the spring, or flitted from branch to branch in the soft white pines over my head; and the red squirrel, running down the closest branch, was especially friendly and curious. To see all the inhabitants of the woods show themselves to you, you simply need to sit quietly for long enough in an inviting spot.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">I was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I went out to my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two large ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a <i>duellum</i>, but a <i>bellum</i>, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in each other’s embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at noon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out. The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members. They fought with more pertinacity than bull-dogs. Neither manifested the least disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was Conquer or die. In the mean while there came along a single red ant on the hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle; probably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from afar,—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red,—he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants. I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men. The more you think of it, the less the difference. And certainly there is not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least, if in the history of America, that will bear a moment’s comparison with this, whether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. For numbers and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots’ side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a Buttrick,—“Fire! for God’s sake fire! —and thousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There was not one hireling there. I have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of Bunker Hill, at least.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012">I witnessed a less peaceful event one day when I went to my wood pile, or rather my stump pile. I saw two large ants, one red and the other much bigger, nearly half an inch long, and black, fighting fiercely with each other. Once they got a hold, they never let go. They struggled and wrestled and rolled on the wood chips nonstop. Looking closer, I was amazed to find that the chips were covered with such fighters, that it wasn't just a duel, but a war between two ant races, the red always matched against the black, and often two red ones to one black. The armies of these warriors covered all the hills and valleys in my woodyard, and the ground was already littered with the dead and dying of both colors. It was the only battle I ever saw, the only battlefield I ever walked while the fight was raging; a war to the death, with the red republicans on one side and the black imperialists on the other. They were locked in deadly combat on every side, yet without any noise I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so determinedly. I watched a pair that were tightly locked together in a small sunny valley in the chips, now at noon ready to fight until sunset or until one died. The smaller red champion had attached himself like a vice to his opponent's front, and through all the tumbling on that field, he never stopped biting at one of his feelers near the base, having already caused the other to break off, while the stronger black one threw him from side to side, and, as I saw on closer inspection, had already stripped him of several limbs. They fought with more stubbornness than bulldogs. Neither showed the slightest inclination to retreat. It was clear that their battle cry was "Conquer or die". Meanwhile, a single red ant came along the hillside of this valley, clearly very excited, who had either defeated his enemy or had not yet joined the battle—probably the latter, as he had lost none of his limbs—whose mother had told him to come back with his shield. Or perhaps he was some Achilles, who had nursed his anger in isolation and had now come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this uneven fight from a distance—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the reds—he approached rapidly until he stood guard within half an inch of the combatants; then, seizing his chance, he sprang on the black warrior and began his attack near the root of his right front leg, leaving the enemy to choose among his own limbs; and so there were three joined for life as if a new kind of bond had been created that put all other ties and glues to shame. By that point, I wouldn't have been shocked to discover they had set up their own orchestras on a prominent spot, constantly playing patriotic tunes to motivate the sluggish and boost the morale of the failing combatants. I myself was somewhat excited as if they had been men. The more you consider it, the smaller the difference. And surely there is no battle recorded in Concord history, at least, if not in American history, that will stand a moment's comparison with this one, whether for the numbers involved in it, or for the patriotism and heroism displayed. In terms of numbers and carnage, it was an Austerlitz or Dresden. The Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots' side, and Luther Blanchard wounded! Why, here every ant was a Buttrick—"Fire! For God's sake, fire!"—and thousands met the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There was not a single mercenary there. I have no doubt that they fought for a principle, as much as our forefathers did, and not to avoid a three-penny tax on their tea; and the outcomes of this battle will be as significant and unforgettable to those concerned as those of the Battle of Bunker Hill, at the very least.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">I took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described were struggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a tumbler on my window-sill, in order to see the issue. Holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy, having severed his remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of the sufferer’s eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite. They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how many other wounds, to divest himself of them; which at length, after half an hour more, he accomplished. I raised the glass, and he went off over the window-sill in that crippled state. Whether he finally survived that combat, and spent the remainder of his days in some Hotel des Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry would not be worth much thereafter. I never learned which party was victorious, nor the cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, of a human battle before my door.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013">I picked up the chip where the three ants I described were fighting, brought it inside, and put it under a glass on my windowsill to see what would happen. Looking at the red ant with a microscope, I saw that although he was busily chewing his enemy's front leg after cutting off his other antenna, his own chest was ripped open, exposing his insides to the black ant's jaws. The black ant's armor seemed too strong to break through. The red ant's eyes glowed with the kind of intensity only war can bring. They battled for another 30 minutes under the glass. When I checked again, the black ant had cut off the heads of his enemies, which hung on either side of him like grim trophies. Despite missing antennae, having only part of a leg, and who knows how many other injuries, he struggled to get rid of the heads, finally succeeding after another half hour. I lifted the glass and he limped away over the windowsill. I don't know if he ultimately survived that fight or lived out his days in a veteran's hospital, but I doubted he'd be very productive after that. I never found out who won or why they were fighting, but I felt unsettled the rest of the day, as if I had witnessed the brutality and bloodshed of human warfare right outside my door.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">Kirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is the only modern author who appears to have witnessed them. “Æneas Sylvius,  say they, “after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree,  adds that “‘This action was fought in the pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity.’ A similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in which the small ones, being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds. This event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern the Second from Sweden.  The battle which I witnessed took place in the Presidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster’s Fugitive-Slave Bill.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">Many a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling cellar, sported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge of his master, and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks’ holes; led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood, and might still inspire a natural terror in its denizens;—now far behind his guide, barking like a canine bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny, then, cantering off, bending the bushes with his weight, imagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family. Once I was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond, for they rarely wander so far from home. The surprise was mutual. Nevertheless the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her days, appears quite at home in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy behavior, proves herself more native there than the regular inhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens in the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. A few years before I lived in the woods there was what was called a “winged cat  in one of the farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker’s. When I called to see her in June,
        1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods, as was her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so use the more common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and was finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet, and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these appendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,  which I keep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for why should not a poet’s cat be winged as well as his horse?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">Many a village dog, only fit to chase turtles in a basement, roamed the woods without his owner knowing. He ineffectively sniffed at old fox and woodchuck holes, perhaps led by a small dog nimbly running through the trees. The dog might still scare the woods' inhabitants, now far behind his guide, barking like a bull at a treed squirrel, then trotting off, bending bushes, imagining he's tracking a stray jerboa. I was once surprised to see a cat walking along the rocky pond shore, as they seldom wander far from home. The surprise was mutual. Still, even the most domestic cat, who has only lounged on a rug, seems at ease in the woods. Her sneaky behavior shows she belongs there more than the regular inhabitants. While berry-picking, I encountered a cat with kittens in the woods, all wild, backs arched and hissing fiercely at me. Years before I lived in the woods, there was a "winged cat" at Mr. Gilian Baker's farm near the pond. When I visited in June 1842, she was out hunting as usual (unsure if male or female, I use the common pronoun). Her owner said she arrived just over a year prior, in April, and they took her in. She was dark brownish-gray with a white throat and paws, and a large bushy fox-like tail. In winter, her fur grew thick, forming 10-12 inch long stripes on her sides, and a muff under her chin—loose on top, matted like felt underneath. These features shed in spring. They gave me her "wings," which I still have. They lack any membrane. Some thought she was part flying squirrel or another wild animal, which is possible since fertile hybrids of martens and housecats exist. She would've been the perfect cat for a poet like me to keep, for shouldn't a poet's cat be winged like his horse?</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016">In the fall the loon (<i>Colymbus glacialis</i>) came, as usual, to moult and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one loon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that, for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often successful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would manœuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a rain.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016">In autumn, the loon (Colymbus glacialis) arrived as usual to shed its feathers and swim in the pond, its wild laughter echoing through the woods before I woke up. As word spread of its arrival, all the hunters from the Mill-dam were on high alert, in boats and on foot, in pairs and trios, armed with modern rifles, tapered bullets, and binoculars. They came through the woods, rustling like fall leaves, with at least ten men for every loon. Some positioned themselves on one side of the pond, others on the opposite side, as the unfortunate bird could not be everywhere at once; if it dived here, it had to surface there. But then the pleasant October breeze picked up, rustling the leaves and rippling the water's surface, making the loon impossible to hear or spot, even as its enemies scanned the pond with binoculars and filled the woods with gunfire. The waves rose up generously and crashed angrily, siding with all waterfowl, and our hunters had to retreat to town, to shops, and to unfinished work. But they succeeded too often. When I went to fetch a bucket of water early in the morning, I often saw this majestic bird gliding out of my cove just a short distance away. If I tried to catch up to it in a boat to see how it would evade me, it would dive and vanish completely, sometimes not reappearing until late in the day. But on the surface, I was more than a match for it. It usually departed in the rain.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0017">As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October afternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon, suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long and loud, and with more reason than before. He manœuvred so cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly surveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed directly under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish, for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part. It is said that loons have been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout,—though Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre, and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up, and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first. It was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This was his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0017">One calm October afternoon, as I paddled along the north shore of the lake, I suddenly spotted a loon sailing out in front of me. I chased after it with my paddle, but every time I got close, it would dive and resurface much farther away, letting out a wild laugh as if mocking me. The loon was a cunning opponent, always choosing to come up in the widest part of the lake, as far from my boat as possible. It was like a game of checkers, trying to guess where it would appear next. Sometimes it seemed to pass right under my boat before popping up on the other side. This loon had incredible endurance, diving again immediately after swimming a great distance. It moved even faster underwater, speeding like a fish to the deepest parts of the lake. Loons have been caught as deep as 80 feet on fishing lines meant for trout. I tried to predict where it would surface based on ripples in the water, but it outsmarted me every time, startling me with its eerie laugh from behind. Its white breast should have given it away, but it still managed to catch me off guard. After an hour, the loon seemed just as energetic, swimming farther than ever. It glided serenely with unruffled feathers, propelling itself with webbed feet underwater. Its usual call was a demonic chuckle, but occasionally it let out a long, unearthly howl that echoed through the woods like a wolf's cry. As the sky grew overcast, the loon let out one final howl, as if summoning the god of loons. Suddenly, a wind rose up from the east, rippling the lake's surface and filling the air with misty rain. I felt as if the loon's prayer had been answered, and its god was displeased with me. So I left the loon to disappear into the distance on the churning waves.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0018">For hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which they will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I thought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason that I do.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0018">For hours on fall days, I watched the ducks cleverly maneuver and stay in the center of the pond, away from the hunter. These are tricks they'll need less in Louisiana swamps. When forced to fly, they would sometimes circle high above the pond, from where they could easily spot other ponds and the river, like tiny black specks in the sky. Long after I thought they had flown off, they would descend in a sloping path a quarter mile to land on an open part of the pond. But besides safety, I don't know what they gained by staying in the middle of Walden, unless they enjoy its water for the same reason I do.</p>
