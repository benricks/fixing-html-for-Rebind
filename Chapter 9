The fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There is but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know the flavor of huckleberries, ask the cow-boy or the partridge. It is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills. The ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as Eternal Justice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither from the country’s hills.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-s transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001"> Sometimes, after being around too many people and hearing too much gossip, and tiring out all my village friends, I would wander even further west than I usually live, into even less visited parts of the town, "to new forests and fields," or, as the sun was setting, would have my dinner of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and store up enough for several days. The fruits don't give their real taste to the person who buys them, or to the one who grows them for sale. There's only one way to get it, but not many do that. If you want to know how huckleberries really taste, ask the cowboy or the partridge. It's a common mistake to think you've tasted huckleberries if you've never picked them yourself. A huckleberry never makes it to Boston; they haven't been seen there since they grew on her three hills. The heavenly and key part of the fruit is lost when the bloom gets rubbed off in the market cart, and they just become animal food. As long as Eternal Justice rules, not one innocent huckleberry can be brought there from the country hills. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">Occasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf, and, after practising various kinds of philosophy, had concluded commonly, by the time I arrived, that he belonged to the ancient sect of Cœnobites. There was one older man, an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds of woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my house as a building erected for the convenience of fishermen; and I was equally pleased when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat together on the pond, he at one end of the boat, and I at the other; but not many words passed between us, for he had grown deaf in his later years, but he occasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well enough with my philosophy. Our intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony, far more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech. When, as was commonly the case, I had none to commune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on the side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts, until I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002"> Sometimes, after finishing my hoeing for the day, I would join an eager friend who had been fishing on the pond since morning. He would sit as quiet and still as a duck or a leaf on the water, and after pondering various philosophies, would usually conclude by the time I got there that he belonged to the old Cœnobite sect. There was one older man, a great fisherman skilled in all sorts of outdoor crafts, who liked to view my house as a structure built for the convenience of anglers. I was also happy when he sat in my doorway to get his fishing lines ready. Every so often we sat together in the boat on the pond, him at one end and me at the other. Not many words were exchanged between us since he had become hard of hearing in his later years, but he would sometimes hum a psalm that went well with my way of thinking. Our time together was always harmonious, and much more pleasant to recall than if we had talked a lot. When I had no one to chat with, which was often the case, I would make the echoes ring out by hitting the side of my boat with a paddle. The sound would ripple and expand, stirring up the surrounding woods like a zookeeper riling up his animals, until I drew a growl from every wooded valley and hillside. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">In warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and saw the perch, which I seemed to have charmed, hovering around me, and the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the wrecks of the forest. Formerly I had come to this pond adventurously, from time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion, and making a fire close to the water’s edge, which we thought attracted the fishes, we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread; and when we had done, far in the night, threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets, which, coming down into the pond, were quenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping in total darkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the haunts of men again. But now I had made my home by the shore.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003"> On warm evenings, I often sat in the boat playing the flute. I watched the perch, which seemed enchanted by my music, hovering around me. The moon shone over the lake bottom, littered with remnants of the forest. In the past, I had come to this pond on adventurous summer nights with a friend. We made a fire by the shore, believing it lured the fish. Using worms on a string, we caught catfish. When we finished late at night, we threw the flaming sticks high into the sky like fireworks. They fell into the water with a loud hiss, leaving us in complete darkness. Whistling a tune, we made our way back to civilization. But now, I had made my home by the water's edge. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Sometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired, I have returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the next day’s dinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and hearing, from time to time, the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand. These experiences were very memorable and valuable to me,—anchored in forty feet of water, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes by thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight, and communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below, or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I drifted in the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight vibration along it, indicative of some life prowling about its extremity, of dull uncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to make up its mind. At length you slowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air. It was very queer, especially in dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk, which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to Nature again. It seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well as downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I caught two fishes as it were with one hook.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004"> After staying in a village parlor until the family went to bed, I sometimes returned to the woods. Partly to catch fish for the next day's meal, I spent the midnight hours fishing from a boat under the moonlight. Owls and foxes sang, and from time to time, I heard the creaking call of an unknown bird nearby. These experiences were unforgettable and priceless to me. I was anchored in forty feet of water, twenty or thirty rods from shore. Sometimes I was surrounded by thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight. A long fishing line connected me with mysterious night-dwelling fish forty feet below. Other times, I drifted in the gentle night breeze, dragging sixty feet of line around the pond. Now and then, I felt a slight tug on the line, a sign of some creature moving with unclear purpose at the end of it. Eventually, I slowly pulled the line up, hand over hand, bringing a grunting, wriggling horned pout to the surface. It was strange, especially on dark nights, when my mind had wandered to immense, universal themes, to feel this faint pull that interrupted my dreams and reconnected me with nature. It was as if I could cast my line up into the air, which was hardly any less solid than the water. In this way, it was like I caught two fish with a single hook. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">The scenery of Walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful, does not approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not long frequented it or lived by its shore; yet this pond is so remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular description. It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one and a half acres; a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the height of forty to eighty feet, though on the south-east and east they attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively, within a quarter and a third of a mile. They are exclusively woodland. All our Concord waters have two colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper, close at hand. The first depends more on the light, and follows the sky. In clear weather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance, especially if agitated, and at a great distance all appear alike. In stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark slate color. The sea, however, is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape being covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as grass. Some consider blue “to be the color of pure water, whether liquid or solid.  But, looking directly down into our waters from a boat, they are seen to be of very different colors. Walden is blue at one time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both. Viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a hill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred this to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green there against the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through the earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last appeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I remember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air. It is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the makers say, to its “body,  but a small piece of the same will be colorless. How large a body of Walden water would be required to reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and, like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness, still more unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal, produces a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a Michael Angelo.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005"> The scenery of Walden is humble yet beautiful, though it may not impress those unfamiliar with its shores. However, the pond's remarkable depth and clarity deserve a detailed description. Walden is a clear, deep green well, measuring half a mile long and nearly two miles around, containing about 61.5 acres. It's a perennial spring amidst pine and oak forests, with no visible inlets or outlets except for clouds and evaporation. The hills around the pond rise steeply forty to eighty feet from the water, reaching about one hundred to 150 feet on the southeast and east sides within a quarter to a third of a mile. They are entirely covered in wood. All the waters in Concord have at least two colors—one seen from a distance, and another up close. The distant color depends more on the light and sky conditions. On clear summer days, the water looks blue from a distance, especially if choppy. In stormy weather, it can appear a dark slate color. Interestingly, the sea is said to look blue one day and green the next without any noticeable changes in the atmosphere. I've seen our river look almost as green as grass when the landscape was blanketed in snow. Some believe pure water is always blue, whether liquid or frozen. However, looking straight down into the water from a boat reveals a variety of colors. Walden itself can appear blue or green, even from the same viewpoint. Suspended between earth and sky, it takes on the colors of both. From a hilltop, it reflects the sky's hue. Up close, it has a yellowish tint near the shore where the sand is visible, transitioning to light green and eventually a uniform dark green deeper in the pond. In certain lights, even from a hill, the shoreline can appear a bright green. Some attribute this to reflections of the foliage, but the color remains consistent even next to the railroad sandbank in spring before the leaves emerge. It may simply result from the blue water mixing with the yellow sand. This shoreline area is also where the ice first melts in spring, warmed by sunlight reflecting off the bottom and conducted through the earth, forming a narrow channel around the still-frozen middle. Like other local waters, when Walden is choppy on clear days, it can look a darker blue than the sky itself at the right angle, with more light mixed in. I've seen a matchless, indescribable light blue while looking at the surface with divided vision, more vivid than the sky, alternating with the original dark green on opposite sides of the waves, which looked comparatively muddy. It's a glassy, greenish-blue color, reminiscent of changeable silks and sword blades, like glimpses of the winter sky through cloud openings in the west before sunset. Yet a single glass of Walden water held up to the light appears as clear as air. It's known that a large pane of glass will have a green tint due to its thickness, while a smaller piece from the same pane will be colorless. I've never determined how much Walden water would be needed to produce a green hue. The water in our river looks black or very dark brown when viewed from directly above. Like most ponds, it lends a yellowish tinge to swimmers, but it's so pure that their bodies appear unnaturally white like alabaster. The distorted and magnified limbs create a monstrous effect, worthy of a Michelangelo study. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see, many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps only an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity, I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006"> The water is so clear that you can easily see the bottom twenty-five or thirty feet down. As you paddle over it, you can spot schools of perch and minnows deep below the surface. The perch are only an inch long but recognizable by their stripes. You might think only ascetic fish could survive there. Years ago, while ice fishing for pickerel, I tossed my ax onto the ice as I stepped ashore. As if guided by an evil force, it slid four or five rods straight into a hole where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Curious, I peered into the hole until I spotted the ax slightly to the side, vertically with the handle gently rocking back and forth with the water's movement. It could have remained that way until the handle rotted away if I hadn't disturbed it. I made another hole right above it with an ice chisel, cut the longest birch I could find nearby with my knife, and fashioned a slip-knot. Carefully lowering it, I looped it over the ax handle and used the birch to pull the ax back out. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side. Some think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable plants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all which however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or two into the water, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where there is usually a little sediment, probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007"> The shoreline consists of a strip of smooth, rounded white stones resembling paving stones, with only a couple of short sandy beaches. It's so steep that in many spots, a single jump will land you in water over your head. If not for the water's remarkable clarity, you wouldn't see the bottom again until it rose on the far side. Some believe it has no bottom at all. The water is never muddy, and a casual glance might suggest there are no weeds whatsoever. A closer look reveals no reeds or rushes, not even a water lily. There are just a few small heart-shaped leaves, pondweeds, and maybe a water shield or two, which a swimmer might not even notice. These plants are clean and vibrant, just like the water they thrive in. The stones reach a rod or two into the water, then the bottom turns to pure sand. In the deepest areas, there is usually a bit of sediment, likely from the decay of leaves blown in over many autumns. Even in the middle of winter, a bright green weed clings to anchors pulled up from the depths. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">We have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner, about two and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre I do not know a third of this pure and well-like character. Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as ever. Not an intermitting spring! Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even then it had commenced to rise and fall, and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now wear, and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world and distiller of celestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered nations’ literatures this has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs presided over it in the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008"> We have another pond just like this one, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner, about two and a half miles west of here. Although I know most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this spot, I don't know of a third pond that is as pure and pristine as this one. Many groups of people have likely drank from, admired, and explored its depths before moving on, yet its water remains as green and clear as ever. It's a constant spring, never running dry! Perhaps Walden Pond was already here on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden. Maybe it was already thawing in a gentle spring rain with mist and a southern breeze, covered with countless ducks and geese that had not heard of the fall, back when such clean lakes were enough for them. Even then it had started to rise and fall and had purified and tinted its waters to the color they are now. It gained a heavenly patent to be the one and only Walden Pond on Earth, the maker of divine dews. Who knows how many forgotten cultures have seen this as the ultimate source of inspiration and poetry? Or which divine spirits watched over it in the Golden Age? It is a precious gem of the highest quality, adorning the crown of Concord. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">Yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their footsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond, even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow shelf-like path in the steep hill-side, alternately rising and falling, approaching and receding from the water’s edge, as old probably as the race of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land. This is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were, in clear white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009"> Perhaps the first people who came to this pond left traces of their footsteps. I was surprised to find a narrow, shelf-like path encircling the pond, even where a thick forest was recently cut down on the shore. The path rises and falls, approaching and receding from the water's edge, likely as old as humans have been here. It was worn by the feet of native hunters and is still occasionally walked on unknowingly by current residents. This path is especially clear when standing in the middle of the frozen pond just after a light snowfall. It appears as an undulating white line, unobscured by plants and branches, visible from a quarter-mile away in many spots where it's barely noticeable up close in summer. The snow highlights it in crisp white, almost like embossed letters. The landscaped grounds of homes that will eventually be built here may retain some evidence of this ancient trail. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">The pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what period, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer, though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness. I can remember when it was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year 1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which place was long since converted into a meadow. But the pond has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of ’52, is just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as it was thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a difference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs. This same summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable that this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and a part of two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as I have ever known it. Flint’s Pond, a mile eastward, allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with Walden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of White Pond.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010"> The pond's water level rises and falls, but no one knows if it happens regularly or how long the cycles last, although many claim to know. It's usually higher in winter and lower in summer, but not always corresponding to the amount of rain and dryness. I remember when it was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet higher than when I lived nearby. There's a narrow sandbar extending into the pond, with very deep water on one side, where I helped boil a pot of chowder about six rods from the main shore around 1824, which hasn't been possible for twenty-five years. On the other hand, my friends didn't believe me when I said that a few years later I often fished from a boat in a hidden cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which long ago turned into a meadow. But the pond has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of '52, it's five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as thirty years ago, and fishing is happening again in the meadow. This is a difference in water level of six or seven feet at most, yet the water from the surrounding hills is very little, so this overflow must be caused by things that affect the deep springs. This same summer, the pond started to fall again. Interestingly, this change in water level seems to take many years to happen, whether it's a regular cycle or not. I've seen it rise once and fall partly twice, and I think that in a dozen or fifteen years the water will be as low as I've ever seen it. Flint's Pond, a mile to the east, and the smaller ponds in between also change their water levels along with Walden, reaching their highest at the same time recently, if you account for the changes caused by water flowing in and out of them. From what I've seen, this is also true for White Pond. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">This rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at least; the water standing at this great height for a year or more, though it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise, pitch-pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others, and, falling again, leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest. On the side of the pond next my house, a row of pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the <i>shore</i> is <i>shorn</i>, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps from time to time. When the water is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain themselves; and I have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore, which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these circumstances. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011"> The periodic rising and falling of Walden's water level serves a purpose. When the water remains high for a year or more, it's harder to walk around the pond, but it kills the shrubs and trees that have grown along the shore since the last rise, including pines, birches, alders, and aspens. When the water level drops again, it leaves a clear shoreline. Unlike many ponds and waters with daily tides, Walden's shore is cleanest when the water is at its lowest. On the side of the pond closest to my house, a row of fifteen-foot tall pines has been killed and knocked over, putting a stop to their spread. Their size shows how many years have passed since the water was last this high. Through this changing water level, the pond claims its shore, and the trees can't take permanent ownership. These are the lips of the lake, and it licks them from time to time. When the water is highest, alders, willows, and maples grow masses of long red roots from their stems, reaching up to four feet above the ground as they try to survive. I've even seen blueberry bushes along the shore, which usually don't bear fruit, produce an abundant crop in these conditions. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved. My townsmen have all heard the tradition, the oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youth, that anciently the Indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his divining rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from that of some English locality,—Saffron Walden, for instance,—one might suppose that it was called originally <i>Walled-in</i> Pond.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012"> Many have wondered how the shore became so evenly paved. The oldest townspeople say they heard a story in their youth that long ago, Native Americans were having a gathering on a hill here that rose as high as the pond now goes deep. The tale claims they used a lot of foul language, though this is a vice the Native Americans were never guilty of. During this, the hill shook and suddenly sank, with only one old woman named Walden escaping, giving the pond its name. Some guess that when the hill shook, these stones rolled down to form the current shore. What's certain is that there was no pond here before, and now there is one. This Native American legend doesn't conflict with the account of an old settler I mentioned, who recalls first coming here with a divining rod, seeing a thin vapor rise from the grass. The hazel rod pointed down, so he decided to dig a well. As for the stones, many still think the waves on these hills can't fully explain them. But I see the surrounding hills have remarkably similar stones, so much that they've piled them into walls along the railroad cut by the pond. Also, most stones are where the shore is steepest. So, unfortunately, it's no longer a mystery to me—I see the paver's work. If the name didn't come from an English place like Saffron Walden, one might think it was originally called Walled-in Pond. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as good as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter, all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are protected from it. The temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where I sat from five o’clock in the afternoon till noon the next day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to 65° or 70° some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42°, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn. The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same day was 45°, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account of its depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my cellar, where it became cool in the night, and remained so during the day; though I also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the pump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013"> The pond was like a well, already dug for me. For four months of the year, its water is as cold and pure as any in town, if not the best. In winter, water exposed to air is colder than protected springs and wells. Pond water left in my room from afternoon to noon the next day, March 6, 1846, with the thermometer reaching 65-70°F at times due to the sun on the roof, was 42°F. This was one degree colder than the coldest village well water. The Boiling Spring was 45°F that day, the warmest water tested, though it's the coldest I know in summer when shallow, stagnant surface water doesn't mix in. Also, in summer, Walden never gets as warm as most sun-exposed water because of its depth. In hot weather, I put a pail in my cool cellar overnight. It stayed good for a week, tasting better than pump water. Campers in summer can have cold water without ice by burying a pail a few feet deep in the shade of their camp. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">There have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds, to say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity, which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see him, perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds, shiners, chivins or roach (<i>Leuciscus pulchellus</i>), a very few breams, and a couple of eels, one weighing four pounds,—I am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and these are the only eels I have heard of here;—also, I have a faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides and a greenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which I mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable. Nevertheless, this pond is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel, though not abundant, are its chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds; a long and shallow one, steel-colored, most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with greenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout. The specific name <i>reticulatus</i> would not apply to this; it should be <i>guttatus</i> rather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch also, and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as the water is purer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few muscels in it; muskrats and minks leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling mud-turtle visits it. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the morning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows (<i>Hirundo bicolor</i>) skim over it, and the peetweets (<i>Totanus macularius</i>)
        “teter  along its stony shores all summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a white-pine over the water; but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the wing of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it tolerates one annual loon. These are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014"> Walden has yielded pickerel, one weighing seven pounds, not to mention another that took off with a reel at great speed, which the angler confidently pegged at eight pounds since he didn't see it. Perch and bullheads, some over two pounds each, shiners, chubs or roach (Leuciscus pulchellus), a handful of breams, and two eels, one four pounds, have also been caught. I'm this specific because a fish's weight is usually its only claim to fame, and these are the only eels known here. I also vaguely recall a small five-inch fish with silver sides and a green-back, like a minnow or dace, which I bring up mainly to connect fact with fable. Still, this pond isn't very rich in fish. Its pickerel, while not plentiful, is its main attraction. I've seen three distinct types of pickerel on the ice at once—a long, shallow, steel-colored one most similar to river catches; a deep, bright golden variety with green hues, the most common here; and another golden one shaped like the last but sprinkled with small dark brown or black spots and a few pale red ones, much like a trout. The name reticulatus wouldn't fit this; guttatus would be better. These fish are all quite firm and heavier than they look. The shiners, bullheads, perch, and all other fish living in this pond are much cleaner, more attractive, and firmer than those in the river and most other ponds due to the cleaner water. Many fish experts would likely classify some as new varieties. The pond also has a clean population of frogs and turtles, and a few mussels. Muskrats and minks leave marks around it, and an occasional passing mud turtle stops by. At times, pushing off my boat in the morning has startled a large mud turtle hidden underneath overnight. Ducks and geese visit in spring and fall, tree swallows (Hirundo bicolor) glide over it, and spotted sandpipers (Totanus macularius) teeter along its rocky banks all summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fish hawk perched on a white pine above the water, but I doubt a gull's wings ever desecrate it like they do Fair Haven. At most, it hosts one loon per year. These are all the notable creatures that frequent it these days. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">You may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore, where the water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts of the pond, some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height, consisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg in size, where all around is bare sand. At first you wonder if the Indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice melted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that. They are similar to those found in rivers; but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here, I know not by what fish they could be made. Perhaps they are the nests of the chivin. These lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015"> On a calm day, you can see some interesting formations from a boat near the sandy eastern shore of the pond, where the water is eight to ten feet deep. There are also some in other parts of the pond. These circular mounds are about six feet wide and one foot tall, made up of small stones smaller than a chicken egg, surrounded by bare sand. At first, you might think that Native Americans built them on the ice for some reason, and they sank to the bottom when the ice melted. But they look too uniform and some seem too new for that. They resemble the ones found in rivers, but since there are no suckers or lampreys in this pond, it's unclear what fish could have made them. Maybe they are nests made by the fallfish. These formations add an intriguing mystery to the pond floor. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016">The shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind’s eye the western indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the beautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves between. The forest has never so good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water’s edge; for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case, but, with its winding shore, the most natural and agreeable boundary to it. There is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a part, or a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on the water side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that direction. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees. There are few traces of man’s hand to be seen. The water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016"> The coastline has enough variation to avoid being dull. I can picture the west coast with its deep inlets, the more dramatic northern shore, and the elegantly curved southern coast, where capes cascade over one another, hinting at hidden bays. The forest is never as striking or lovely as when viewed from the center of a small lake surrounded by hills that ascend from the water's edge. The water that reflects the forest creates the ideal foreground and forms the most natural, pleasing border with its winding shore. The forest's edge is pristine and flawless, unlike areas cleared by axes or bordered by farmland. The trees have plenty of space to grow toward the water, and each one extends its strongest branch in that direction. Nature has created a natural boundary, and the eye is gradually drawn from the low shrubs along the shore to the tallest trees. There are minimal signs of human influence. The water caresses the shore just as it did a millennium ago. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0017">A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0017"> A lake is nature's most stunning and revealing aspect. It is like the earth's eye; gazing into it, one can gauge the profoundness of their own being. The riverside trees lining the shore are the delicate lashes that frame it, while the forested slopes and bluffs surrounding it are like overarching eyebrows. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0018">Standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a calm September afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore line indistinct, I have seen whence came the expression, “the glassy surface of a lake.  When you invert your head, it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming against the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another. You would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as it were by mistake, and are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the two, you survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as glass, except where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as I have said, a swallow skims so low as to touch it. It may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and there is one bright flash where it emerges, and another where it strikes the water; sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed; or here and there, perhaps, is a thistle-down floating on its surface, which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again. It is like molten glass cooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet smoother and darker water, separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb, boom of the water nymphs, resting on it. From a hill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part; for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is advertised,—this piscine murder will out,—and from my distant perch I distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter. You can even detect a water-bug (<i>Gyrinus</i>) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a mile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters glide over it without rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it, but apparently, in calm days, they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it. It is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump on such a height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees. Over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and assuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred, the trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again. Not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples, in lines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of its fountain, the gentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast. The thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable. How peaceful the phenomena of the lake! Again the works of man shine as in the spring. Ay, every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at mid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning. Every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light; and if an oar falls, how sweet the echo!</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0018"> On a calm September afternoon, standing on the sandy beach at the east end of the pond, a slight haze blurs the opposite shoreline. This is where the phrase "the glassy surface of a lake" comes from. When you tilt your head, it looks like the finest thread stretched across the valley, gleaming against the distant pines, separating layers of air. You'd think you could walk under it to the opposite hills, and swallows skimming over could perch on it. They sometimes dive below this line by mistake and are surprised. Looking westward over the pond, you must shield your eyes from both the reflected and real sun, equally bright. If you look closely between them, the surface is as smooth as glass, except for evenly spaced skater insects creating the finest sparkle, or a duck preening, or a swallow skimming low enough to touch it. In the distance, a fish may leap in an arc, with bright flashes where it emerges and strikes the water, sometimes revealing the whole silvery arc. Or a thistle-down may float on the surface, darted at by fish, dimpling it. It's like molten glass cooled but not hardened, the few specks pure and beautiful like imperfections in glass. You can often see even smoother, darker water, separated as if by an invisible cobweb, where water nymphs rest. From a hilltop, you can see a fish leap almost anywhere, as any pickerel or shiner picking an insect from the smooth surface visibly disturbs the whole lake's balance. It's amazing how intricately this simple fact is announced—this fish murder will be known—and from my distant perch I see the circling ripples when they're six rods wide. You can even spot a water-bug (Gyrinus) endlessly moving over the smooth surface a quarter-mile away; they slightly furrow the water, making a noticeable ripple bordered by two spreading lines, but skaters glide over it without visibly rippling it. When the surface is noticeably stirred up, there are no skaters or water-bugs, but on calm days, they apparently leave their shelters and bravely glide out from shore in short bursts until they fully cover it. It's calming, on one of those nice fall days when the sun's warmth is fully enjoyed, to sit on a stump at such a height, overlooking the pond, and watch the dimpling circles endlessly drawn on its otherwise unseen surface amid the mirrored skies and trees. Over this vast expanse, any disturbance is instantly gently smoothed and soothed, like when a jarred vase of water sends trembling circles to the edge and all is smooth once more. Not a fish can jump or an insect land on the pond without it being reported in encircling dimples, in lines of beauty, like the constant welling of its fountain, the soft beating of its life, the lifting of its chest. Thrills of joy and pain are indistinguishable. How serene the lake's phenomena! Again man's works shine as in spring. Yes, every leaf, twig, stone and cobweb sparkles now in mid-afternoon as when covered with dew on a spring morning. Every moving oar or insect makes a flash of light; and if an oar drops, how sweet the echo! </p>

We shall, perhaps, look down thus on the surface of air at length, and mark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it.</p>

One November afternoon, in the calm at the end of a rain storm of several days’ duration, when the sky was still completely overcast and the air was full of mist, I observed that the pond was remarkably smooth, so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface; though it no longer reflected the bright tints of October, but the sombre November colors of the surrounding hills. Though I passed over it as gently as possible, the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost as far as I could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections. But, as I was looking over the surface, I saw here and there at a distance a faint glimmer, as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be collected there, or, perchance, the surface, being so smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom. Paddling gently to one of these places, I was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of a rich bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it. In such transparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the clouds, I seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left, their fins, like sails, set all around them. There were many such schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight, sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly and alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly took refuge in the depths. At length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches long, at once above the surface. Even as late as the fifth of December, one year, I saw some dimples on the surface, and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately, the air being full of mist, I made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward; already the rain seemed rapidly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek, and I anticipated a thorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were produced by the perch, which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths, and I saw their schools dimly disappearing; so I spent a dry afternoon after all.</p>

Then, usually in November on a calm day, there is absolutely nothing to disturb the surface. One November afternoon, after a multi-day rain storm when the sky was still fully overcast and misty, I noticed the pond was remarkably smooth, making it hard to distinguish its surface. Though it no longer mirrored October's bright colors, it reflected the somber November hues of the surrounding hills. Even passing over it as gently as possible, the small ripples from my boat spread almost as far as I could see, giving the reflections a ribbed look. But, while scanning the surface, I spotted faint glimmers here and there in the distance, as if some skater insects that survived the frosts might be gathered there, or perhaps the smooth surface revealed where a spring rose from the bottom. Paddling softly to one of these spots, I was amazed to find myself encircled by countless small perch, about five inches long, with rich bronze color in the green water. They were playing there, constantly coming to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles. In such clear and seemingly endless water, mirroring the clouds, I felt like I was floating through the air in a balloon. Their swimming seemed like a kind of flight or hovering, as if they were a tight flock of birds just below my level on either side, their fins spread around them like sails. The pond had many such schools, apparently taking advantage of the brief time before winter would put an icy lid over their wide skylight. Sometimes they made the surface look like a light breeze hit it, or a few raindrops fell. When I approached carelessly and startled them, they made a sudden splash and ripple with their tails, as if someone hit the water with a leafy branch, and quickly hid in the depths. Eventually, the wind picked up, the mist grew, and waves started to run. The perch jumped much higher than before, halfway out of the water, a hundred black dots, three inches long, above the surface at once. Even as late as December 5 one year, I saw some dimples on the surface. Thinking it was about to pour, with the air full of mist, I rushed to grab the oars and row home, already feeling like the rain was quickly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek. I expected to get completely drenched. But suddenly the dimples stopped, caused by the perch that my oar noise had scared into the depths, and I saw their schools faintly disappearing. So I ended up spending a dry afternoon after all. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0022">An old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when it was dark with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl, and that there were many eagles about it. He came here a-fishing, and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at the ends. It was very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it became water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom. He did not know whose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter, who lived by the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there was an iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it would come floating up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it would go back into deep water and disappear. I was pleased to hear of the old log canoe, which took the place of an Indian one of the same material but more graceful construction, which perchance had first been a tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float there for a generation, the most proper vessel for the lake. I remember that when I first looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been blown over formerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood was cheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0022"> An elderly man who frequented this pond nearly 60 years ago, when it was surrounded by dark forests, told me that back then he sometimes saw it teeming with ducks and other waterfowl, and there were many eagles around. He came here to fish, using an old log canoe he found on the shore. It was made from two hollowed out and connected white-pine logs, cut square at the ends. It was very awkward but lasted many years before taking on water and possibly sinking. He didn't know who owned it; it belonged to the pond. He made an anchor cable out of strips of hickory bark tied together. A potter who lived by the pond before the Revolution once told him there was an iron chest on the bottom that he had seen. Sometimes it would float to the shore, but when approached, it would retreat to deep water and vanish. I was happy to hear about the old log canoe, a fitting vessel for the lake, taking the place of a more elegant Indian one of the same material that perhaps started as a bankside tree before falling into the water to float for a generation. I recall that when I first peered into these depths, many large trunks could be seen indistinctly on the bottom, either blown over long ago or left on the ice during the last harvest when wood was cheaper, but now they have mostly vanished. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape vines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep, and the woods on them were then so high, that, as you looked down from the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger, floating over its surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle, and lying on my back across the seats, in a summer forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the sand, and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry. Many a forenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do I regret that I did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teacher’s desk. But since I left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste, and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood, with occasional vistas through which you see the water. My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023"> When I first rowed a boat on Walden Pond, it was totally encircled by dense, towering pine and oak forests. In some of its inlets, grapevines had grown over the trees near the shore, creating natural canopies that a boat could glide under. The hills that make up its banks are so sharp and the trees on them were so tall back then that, looking down from the western side, it resembled an outdoor theater for some sort of forest performance. I spent countless hours in my youth drifting across its surface as the breeze directed, having rowed out to the center and lying on my back across the seats on a summer morning, daydreaming until my boat bumped into the sand. I would get up to see which shore destiny had steered me to. Those were days when laziness was the most appealing and fruitful activity. Many a morning I snuck away, choosing to spend the best part of the day like this, for I was wealthy, if not in cash, then in sunny hours and summer days, and I spent them freely. I don't regret not wasting more of them in a workshop or at a teacher's desk. But since I departed those banks, the lumberjacks have damaged them even more, and now for years there will be no more wandering through the forest paths, with occasional glimpses of the water. My inspiration may be forgiven if she falls silent from now on. How can you expect the birds to sing when their trees are chopped down? </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0024">Now the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know where it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are thinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!—to earn their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug! That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks! Where is the country’s champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet him at the Deep Cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0024"> The trees, old canoe, and dark woods around the pond are gone now. The villagers barely remember where it is. Instead of going there to swim or drink, they want to pipe the sacred water to the village to wash dishes! They'll access Walden by turning a faucet or pulling a plug. That awful train, heard loudly throughout town, has muddied the Boiling Spring and eaten all the trees on Walden's banks. It's a Trojan horse, full of hired men, brought by greedy outsiders! Where is the town's hero to confront it and drive a spear into the swollen menace? </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0025">Nevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears best, and best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it, but few deserve that honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and then that, and the Irish have built their sties by it, and the railroad has infringed on its border, and the ice-men have skimmed it once, it is itself unchanged, the same water which my youthful eyes fell on; all the change is in me. It has not acquired one permanent wrinkle after all its ripples. It is perennially young, and I may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore. It struck me again tonight, as if I had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the same woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and it <i>may</i> be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and clarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord. I see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can almost say, Walden, is it you?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0025"> Of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden ages best and maintains its purity most effectively. Many men have been compared to it, but few truly deserve that honor. Though woodcutters have cleared the shores, the Irish have built their shacks nearby, the railroad has encroached on its border, and ice harvesters have skimmed its surface, the lake itself remains unchanged—the very same water my young eyes gazed upon. The only change is within me. After all its ripples, Walden has not gained a single lasting wrinkle. It is eternally youthful, and even now I can watch a swallow dip down to seemingly pluck an insect from its surface, just as in days past. Tonight it struck me again, as if I hadn't seen it nearly every day for over twenty years—Walden, that same forest lake I discovered so long ago, is still here. Where a forest was felled last winter, another is already growing back vigorously along the shore. The same thoughts well up to its surface as they did then. It remains the same fountain of liquid joy and contentment to itself, its Creator, and perhaps to me as well. Surely it is the work of an honest, guileless man. With his own hand he shaped this body of water, deepened and purified it in his mind, and through his will gifted it to Concord. I can see by Walden's countenance that the same reflections visit it still. I am almost compelled to ask—Walden, is it really you? </p>

The engineer does not forget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day.

If by living thus reserved and austere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has acquired such wonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively impure waters of Flint’s Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0037"> I've mentioned that Walden has no clear inlet or outlet, but it's indirectly connected to the higher Flint's Pond through a series of small ponds, and directly linked to the lower Concord River by a similar chain of ponds it may have once flowed through. With a bit of digging, which I hope never happens, it could flow that way again. If living like a hermit in the woods for so long has given Walden such amazing purity, who would want the relatively dirty water of Flint's Pond mixed in, or have Walden's sweetness lost in the ocean waves? </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0038">Flint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea, lies about a mile east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to contain one hundred and ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in fish; but it is comparatively shallow, and not remarkably pure. A walk through the woods thither was often my recreation. It was worth the while, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the waves run, and remember the life of mariners. I went a-chestnutting there in the fall, on windy days, when the nuts were dropping into the water and were washed to my feet; and one day, as I crept along its sedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon the mouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was sharply defined, as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore, and had as good a moral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have pushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at the north end of this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water, and the rushes which grew in Indian file, in waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank behind rank, as if the waves had planted them. There also I have found, in considerable quantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots, of pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and perfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either solid grass, or have a little sand in the middle. At first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a pebble; yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch long, and they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover, the waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear down a material which has already acquired consistency. They preserve their form when dry for an indefinite period.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0038"> Flint's Pond, also known as Sandy Pond, is located about a mile east of Walden in Lincoln. It is our largest lake and inland sea, said to cover 197 acres. While it has more fish than Walden, it is relatively shallow and not exceptionally clean. I often enjoyed walking through the woods to Flint's Pond. It was worthwhile just to feel the wind on my face and watch the waves, imagining the life of sailors. In the fall, I would go there to collect chestnuts on windy days, as the nuts dropped into the water and washed up at my feet. One day, as I walked along the reedy shore with the fresh spray in my face, I stumbled upon the decaying remains of a boat. The sides were gone, leaving just an imprint of the flat bottom in the rushes, yet its shape was still clearly defined. It was as striking as any shipwreck one might find on the seashore, with an equally powerful lesson. By now, the wreck has decomposed into the pond shore, indistinguishable among the reeds and rushes that have grown through it. I used to admire the ripples in the sand at the north end of the pond, hardened by the water's pressure, and the rushes that grew in wavy, parallel lines matching the ripple patterns. There I also found intriguing spherical balls, apparently made of fine grass or roots, perhaps from pipewort, ranging from half an inch to four inches in diameter. These balls wash back and forth in the shallow water on the sandy bottom and sometimes get tossed onto the shore. They are either solid grass or have a bit of sand in the center. At first glance, you might think the waves formed them like a pebble, but even the smallest ones are made of equally coarse, half-inch long materials, and they only appear during one season each year. I suspect the waves do not create these balls so much as erode a material that has already become solid. The balls retain their shape indefinitely when dry. </p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0039"><i>Flint’s Pond!</i> Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right had the unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water, whose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some skin-flint, who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar, or a bright cent, in which he could see his own brazen face; who regarded even the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers; his fingers grown into crooked and horny talons from the long habit of grasping harpy-like;—so it is not named for me. I go not there to see him nor to hear of him; who never <i>saw</i> it, who never bathed in it, who never loved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a good word for it, nor thanked God that he had made it. Rather let it be named from the fishes that swim in it, the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it, the wild flowers which grow by its shores, or some wild man or child the thread of whose history is interwoven with its own; not from him who could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor or legislature gave him,—him who thought only of its money value; whose presence perchance cursed all the shore; who exhausted the land around it, and would fain have exhausted the waters within it; who regretted only that it was not English hay or cranberry meadow,—there was nothing to redeem it, forsooth, in his eyes,—and would have drained and sold it for the mud at its bottom. It did not turn his mill, and it was no <i>privilege</i> to him to behold it. I respect not his labors, his farm where every thing has its price; who would carry the landscape, who would carry his God, to market, if he could get any thing for him; who goes to market <i>for</i> his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows free, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees no fruits, but dollars; who loves not the beauty of his fruits, whose fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars. Give me the poverty that enjoys true wealth. Farmers are respectable and interesting to me in proportion as they are poor,—poor farmers. A model farm! where the house stands like a fungus in a muck-heap, chambers for men, horses, oxen, and swine, cleansed and uncleansed, all contiguous to one another! Stocked with men! A great grease-spot, redolent of manures and buttermilk! Under a high state of cultivation, being manured with the hearts and brains of men! As if you were to raise your potatoes in the church-yard! Such is a model farm.</p>

It's not named for me. I don't go there to see or hear of him, a man who never saw it, swam in it, loved it, guarded it, praised it, or thanked God for creating it. It should be named for the fish that swim there, the birds or animals that visit it, the wildflowers along its shores, or some free spirit whose story is woven into its own—not for the man whose only claim was a deed from a like-minded neighbor or government, who only cared about its cash value; whose very presence damned the shore; who drained the land around it and would have drained the water too; who only wished it was a field of English hay or cranberries, seeing nothing else worthwhile in his eyes, and would have emptied and sold it for the mud on the bottom. It didn't power his mill, and to him, beholding it was no privilege. I don't respect his work, his farm where everything has a price tag; a man who'd sell the very landscape, even his God, to the highest bidder; whose farm grows nothing free, whose fields yield no crops, whose meadows sprout no flowers, whose trees bear no fruit, only money; who doesn't love the beauty of what he grows, whose harvest isn't ripe until it turns to cash. Give me the poverty of true wealth instead. I respect farmers only as much as they are poor—poor farmers. A model farm! Where the house sprouts like a mushroom from a dung heap, with rooms for men, horses, oxen, and pigs, clean and filthy, all crammed together! Stuffed full of men!

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0042">Since the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned Walden, perhaps the most attractive, if not the most beautiful, of all our lakes, the gem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its commonness, whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands. In these as in other respects, however, it is a lesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would say they must be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its waters are of the same hue. As at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather, looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters are of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color. Many years since I used to go there to collect the sand by cart-loads, to make sand-paper with, and I have continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it proposes to call it Virid Lake. Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine Lake, from the following circumstance. About fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine hereabouts, though it is not a distinct species, projecting above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was even supposed by some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood there. I find that even so long ago as 1792, in a “Topographical Description of the Town of Concord,  by one of its citizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the author, after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds: “In the middle of the latter may be seen, when the water is very low, a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although the roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water; the top of this tree is broken off, and at that place measures fourteen inches in diameter.  In the spring of ’49 I talked with the man who lives nearest the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work, he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he had expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then. There were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt. He thought that it might have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally blown over into the pond, and after the top had become waterlogged, while the butt-end was still dry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end up. His father, eighty years old, could not remember when it was not there. Several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom, where, owing to the undulation of the surface, they look like huge water snakes in motion.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0042"> White Pond, possibly the most charming, if not the prettiest, of all our lakes, is a woodland gem that has been desecrated by woodcutters, the railroad, and myself. Its name, whether stemming from the exceptional clarity of its waters or the hue of its sands, is ordinary due to its prevalence. However, it is a smaller sibling of Walden in these and other aspects. They resemble each other so closely that one would assume they are linked underground. It has the same rocky shore and waters of the same color. Like at Walden, on hot summer days, peering down through the trees at some of its bays that are shallow enough for the bottom reflection to color them, its waters have a hazy bluish-green or sea-green tint. Many years ago, I used to go there to gather sand by the cartload to make sandpaper, and I have continued visiting ever since. A regular visitor proposes naming it Virid Lake. It could perhaps be called Yellow-Pine Lake due to the following event. About fifteen years ago, one could see the top of pitch pine, locally known as yellow pine, though not a separate species, sticking out above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. Some even thought the pond had dropped, and this was part of the original forest that once stood there. I discovered that as far back as 1792, in a "Topographical Description of the Town of Concord" by one of its residents, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the author, after mentioning Walden and White Ponds, adds: "In the middle of the latter, when the water is very low, a tree can be seen that looks as if it grew where it now stands, even though its roots are fifty feet below the water's surface; the top of this tree is broken off, and at that point it measures fourteen inches in diameter". In the spring of '49, I spoke with the man who lives closest to the pond in Sudbury, who said he had removed this tree ten or fifteen years prior. To the best of his recollection, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was winter, and he had been harvesting ice in the morning and had decided that in the afternoon, with the help of his neighbors, he would remove the old yellow pine. He sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore, and used oxen to haul it over, along, and out onto the ice; but, before he had gotten far in his work, he was astonished to discover that it was upside down, with the branch stumps pointing downward and the small end securely lodged in the sandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the large end, and he had hoped to get a good saw log, but it was so rotten that it was only suitable for fuel if that. He had some of it in his shed at the time. There were ax and woodpecker marks on the butt. He speculated that it might have been a dead tree on the shore that finally blew over into the pond, and after the top became waterlogged while the butt-end was still dry and light, it drifted out and sank upside down. His eighty-year-old father couldn't recall a time when it wasn't there. Several fairly large logs can still be seen on the bottom, where they resemble giant moving water snakes due to the surface undulation. </p>

Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or the common sweet flag, the blue flag (<i>Iris versicolor</i>) grows thinly in the pure water, rising from the stony bottom all around the shore, where it is visited by humming birds in June; and the color both of its bluish blades and its flowers, and especially their reflections, are in singular harmony with the glaucous water.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0044">White Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth, Lakes of Light. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to be clutched, they would, perchance, be carried off by slaves, like precious stones, to adorn the heads of emperors; but being liquid, and ample, and secured to us and our successors forever, we disregard them, and run after the diamond of Kohinoor. They are too pure to have a market value; they contain no muck. How much more beautiful than our lives, how much more transparent than our characters, are they! We never learned meanness of them. How much fairer than the pool before the farmer’s door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the clean wild ducks come. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds with their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but what youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of Nature? She flourishes most alone, far from the towns where they reside. Talk of heaven! ye disgrace earth.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0044"> White Pond and Walden are immense crystals on the earth's surface, Lakes of Light. If they were frozen solid and small enough to grasp, they might be taken by slaves, like precious gems, to decorate emperors' crowns. But being liquid, vast, and ours and our descendants' forever, we ignore them and chase the Kohinoor diamond. They're too pure to have a price; they hold no filth. How much lovelier than our lives, how much clearer than our natures, are they! We never learned pettiness from them. How much more beautiful than the pond by the farmer's door, where his ducks swim! Clean wild ducks come here. Nature has no human dweller who values her. The birds with their feathers and songs match the flowers, but what young person joins Nature's wild, abundant beauty? She thrives best alone, far from their towns. You speak of heaven, but you dishonor the earth. </p>
