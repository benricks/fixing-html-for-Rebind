Thank Heaven, here is not all the world. The buck-eye does not grow in New England, and the mocking-bird is rarely heard here. The wild-goose is more of a cosmopolite than we; he breaks his fast in Canada, takes a luncheon in the Ohio, and plumes himself for the night in a southern bayou. Even the bison, to some extent, keeps pace with the seasons, cropping the pastures of the Colorado only till a greener and sweeter grass awaits him by the Yellowstone. Yet we think that if rail-fences are pulled down, and stone-walls piled up on our farms, bounds are henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If you are chosen town-clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer: but you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe is wider than our views of it.</p>

Thankfully, the world is vast. The buckeye tree doesn't grow in New England, and mockingbirds are uncommon. Wild geese are more worldly than us; they eat breakfast in Canada, lunch in Ohio, and groom themselves for the night in a southern marsh. Even bison move with the seasons to some degree, grazing Colorado pastures until greener, tastier grass beckons in Yellowstone. Yet we believe that removing rail fences and stacking stone walls on our farms sets boundaries on our lives and seals our fates. If you're elected town clerk, you may think you can't visit Tierra del Fuego this summer, but you can still go to a land of hellish fire. The universe is grander than our perception of it.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">Yet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious passengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum. The other side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent. Our voyaging is only great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin merely. One hastens to Southern Africa to chase the giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How long, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to shoot one’s self.—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">Still, we should more often peer over the railing of our ship, as inquisitive travelers, rather than making the journey like foolish deckhands picking at loose fibers. The opposite end of the world is simply the residence of our pen pal. Our seafaring is merely circumnavigating, and physicians treat only superficial ailments. One hurries to the southern part of Africa to pursue the giraffe, but certainly that is not the prey he seeks. How long, I ask, would someone stalk giraffes if able? Hunting birds may also provide uncommon amusement, but I believe taking one's own life would be a more admirable target.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">What does Africa,—what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior white on the chart? black though it may prove, like the coast, when discovered. Is it the source of the Nile, or the Niger, or the Mississippi, or a North-West Passage around this continent, that we would find? Are these the problems which most concern mankind? Is Franklin the only man who is lost, that his wife should be so earnest to find him? Does Mr. Grinnell know where he himself is? Be rather the Mungo Park, the Lewis and Clarke and Frobisher, of your own streams and oceans; explore your own higher latitudes,—with shiploads of preserved meats to support you, if they be necessary; and pile the empty cans sky-high for a sign. Were preserved meats invented to preserve meat merely? Nay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a petty state, a hummock left by the ice. Yet some can be patriotic who have no <i>self</i>-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea Exploring Expedition, with all its parade and expense, but an indirect recognition of the fact, that there are continents and seas in the moral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet unexplored by him, but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals, in a government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one, than it is to explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being alone.—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">What do Africa and the West represent? Is our own inner self uncharted, even if it turns out to be dark like the coast when explored? Are we seeking the source of the Nile, Niger, Mississippi, or a Northwest Passage around this continent? Are these the most important issues for humanity? Is Franklin the only lost man, that his wife should be so desperate to find him? Does Mr. Grinnell even know where he is? Instead, be the Mungo Park, Lewis and Clark, and Frobisher of your own rivers and seas; explore your own higher realms, with shiploads of supplies if needed, and stack the empty containers high as a marker. Were canned foods made just to store food? No, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds inside you, opening new paths of thought, not trade. Every person is the ruler of a domain next to which the Czar's earthly empire is merely a small mound left by ice. Yet some can be patriotic without self-respect, sacrificing the greater for the lesser. They cherish the land that will bury them but feel no connection to the spirit that may still give life to their remains. Patriotism is a worm in their minds. What was the point of that South Sea Exploring Expedition, with all its fanfare and cost, but an implicit admission that there are continents and oceans in the moral realm that each person is a link to but has left unexplored? Yet it is easier to voyage thousands of miles through cold, storms, and cannibals in a government vessel with 500 men and boys to help, than to explore the private sea - the Atlantic and Pacific of one's own soul - alone.</p>

Yet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps find some “Symmes’ Hole  by which to get at the inside at last. England and France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front on this private sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of land, though it is without doubt the direct way to India. If you would learn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all nations, if you would travel farther than all travellers, be naturalized in all climes, and cause the Sphinx to dash her head against a stone, even obey the precept of the old philosopher, and Explore thyself. Herein are demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the defeated and deserters go to the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on that farthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the Pacific, nor conduct toward a worn-out China or Japan, but leads on direct a tangent to this sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun down, moon down, and at last earth down too.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012">It's not worthwhile to travel the globe just to count the cats in Zanzibar. But do this until you can do better, and you might find a secret passage to reach the center. England, France, Spain, Portugal, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast all border this private sea, yet no ship from them has dared to sail out of sight of land, although it's surely the most direct route to India. If you wish to learn all languages and adapt to the customs of all nations, if you want to journey further than all travelers and become a native of all climates, and make the Sphinx smash her head on a rock, then follow the old philosopher's advice: Explore yourself. This demands keen perception and courage. Only the defeated and deserters go to war, cowards who flee and enlist. Embark now on that ultimate western path, which doesn't stop at the Mississippi or the Pacific, nor leads toward an exhausted China or Japan, but goes straight on a tangent to this world, through summer, winter, day, night, sunset, moonset, and finally the end of the earth itself.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">It is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery “to ascertain what degree of resolution was necessary in order to place one’s self in formal opposition to the most sacred laws of society.  He declared that “a soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much courage as a foot-pad, —“that honor and religion have never stood in the way of a well-considered and a firm resolve.  This was manly, as the world goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man would have found himself often enough “in formal opposition  to what are deemed “the most sacred laws of society,  through obedience to yet more sacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without going out of his way. It is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to society, but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself through obedience to the laws of his being, which will never be one of opposition to a just government, if he should chance to meet with such. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0013">It is said that Mirabeau turned to highway robbery "to determine how much courage was needed to openly defy society's most important laws." He stated that "a soldier fighting in the army needs less than half the bravery of a robber," and that "honor and religion have never prevented a well-planned and strong decision." This was bold, by society's standards, yet also reckless, if not rash. A wiser person would have often found themselves "formally opposing" what are considered "society's most sacred laws," by following even higher laws, thus testing their resolve without going to extremes. It is not a person's role to take such a stance against society, but to stay true to their values, which will never oppose a fair government, if they happen to encounter one.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one. It is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves. I had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my door to the pond-side; and though it is five or six years since I trod it, it is still quite distinct. It is true, I fear that others may have fallen into it, and so helped to keep it open. The surface of the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world, for there I could best see the moonlight amid the mountains. I do not wish to go below now.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0014">I left the woods for a good reason, just as I had gone there for one. Maybe I felt I had more lives to experience and couldn't devote more time to that particular one. It's amazing how easily we fall into a routine and create a well-worn path for ourselves. Within a week of living there, my feet had carved a trail from my door to the pond, and although it's been five or six years since I last walked it, the path is still quite clear. Granted, I worry that others may have discovered it and helped keep it open. The earth's surface is soft and easily marked by human feet, much like the paths our minds travel. The roads of the world must be so worn and dusty, the ruts of tradition and conformity so deep! I had no desire to travel below deck, but preferred to go before the mast and stand on the deck of the world, where I could best see the moonlight among the mountains. I don't want to go below now.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">I discovered this through my experience: if you move forward with confidence towards your dreams and try to live the life you've envisioned, you'll find success that exceeds your everyday expectations. You'll leave some things in the past, cross an unseen line, and new, more universal and open-minded principles will take hold in your life. The old rules will expand and be interpreted more generously in your favor, and you'll experience the freedom of a higher state of existence. As you make your life simpler, the ways of the universe will seem less complicated. Loneliness, poverty and weakness will lose their sting. If you've built castles in the sky, don't consider it wasted effort - that's exactly where they belong. Now simply lay the groundwork beneath them.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016">It is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you shall speak so that they can understand you. Neither men nor toad-stools grow so. As if that were important, and there were not enough to understand you without them. As if Nature could support but one order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as quadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and <i>hush</i> and <i>who</i>, which Bright can understand, were the best English. As if there were safety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not be <i>extra-vagant</i> enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow limits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of which I have been convinced. <i>Extra vagance!</i> it depends on how you are yarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another latitude, is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail, leaps the cow-yard fence, and runs after her calf, in milking time. I desire to speak somewhere <i>without</i> bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he should speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future or possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our outlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an insensible perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly <i>translated</i>; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016">It's absurd for England and America to demand that you speak in a way they understand. Neither people nor mushrooms grow that way. As if that mattered, and there weren't enough who understand you without them. As if Nature could only support one kind of understanding, couldn't sustain birds as well as four-legged creatures, flying things as well as crawling ones, and the sounds that Bright can understand were the only proper English. As if safety only existed in foolishness. My biggest fear is that my words won't be wild enough, won't stray far enough past the confines of my everyday life to capture the truth I'm convinced of. Wild! It all depends on your perspective. The migrating buffalo seeking new fields isn't wild like the cow that knocks over the milk pail, jumps the fence, and chases her calf at milking time. I want to speak without limits, like a man who's truly awake, to others who are also awake. I'm sure I can never exaggerate enough to even begin to express the truth. Who, after hearing beautiful music, ever worried about speaking too passionately again? Facing the future's possibilities, we should live loosely, undefined at the edges, our outlines hazy on that side, like our shadows revealing an imperceptible sweat toward the sun. The fleeting truth of our words should always expose the shortcomings of what's left unsaid. Their truth is instantly clear; only its literal marker remains. The words that express our faith and devotion aren't precise, yet they are meaningful and sweet-smelling like incense to higher beings.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0017">Why level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as common sense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which they express by snoring. Sometimes we are inclined to class those who are once-and-a-half-witted with the half-witted, because we appreciate only a third part of their wit. Some would find fault with the morning-red, if they ever got up early enough. “They pretend,  as I hear, “that the verses of Kabir have four different senses; illusion, spirit, intellect, and the exoteric doctrine of the Vedas;  but in this part of the world it is considered a ground for complaint if a man’s writings admit of more than one interpretation. While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0017">Why always lower our standards to the most basic understanding, and laud that as common sense? The most typical sense is that of people sleeping, which they show by snoring. At times we tend to group those with one-and-a-half times the wit with the dimwitted, since we only grasp a third of their cleverness. A few would criticize the red dawn, if they ever woke up early enough. "They claim," as I hear, "that Kabir's poems have four distinct meanings: illusion, spirit, intellect, and the Vedas' literal teachings." But here it's seen as a reason to object if someone's works have more than one meaning. While England tries to fix the potato blight, won't anyone try to remedy the mind rot, which is much more common and deadly?</p>

If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer? If the condition of things which we were made for is not yet, what were any reality which we can substitute? We will not be shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we with pains erect a heaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done we shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the former were not?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0020">Why should we be in such a rush to succeed, especially in risky ventures? If someone doesn't keep up with their peers, maybe it's because they march to the beat of their own drum. Let them follow their own rhythm, no matter how different it may be. There's no need to grow up as fast as an apple tree or an oak. Should they skip spring and jump right to summer? If the world we were meant for doesn't exist yet, why settle for an inferior substitute? We shouldn't let ourselves get stranded on an empty dream. Why go through the trouble of building an artificial blue glass sky, knowing we'll still gaze longingly at the real heavens above?</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0021">There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having considered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a perfect work time does not enter, he said to himself, It shall be perfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else in my life. He proceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it should not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and rejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for they grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a moment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated piety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he made no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed at a distance because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a stock in all respects suitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and with the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in the sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere he had put on the ferrule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma had awoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to mention these things? When the finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly expanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations of Brahma. He had made a new system in making a staff, a world with full and fair proportions; in which, though the old cities and dynasties had passed away, fairer and more glorious ones had taken their places. And now he saw by the heap of shavings still fresh at his feet, that, for him and his work, the former lapse of time had been an illusion, and that no more time had elapsed than is required for a single scintillation from the brain of Brahma to fall on and inflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The material was pure, and his art was pure; how could the result be other than wonderful?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0021">There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who wanted to achieve perfection. One day, he decided to make a flawless staff. Knowing that time is a factor in imperfect work but not in perfect creations, he vowed to make it perfect, even if it took his entire life. He went to the forest to find the ideal wood, refusing to use unsuitable material. As he searched for the perfect stick, his friends gradually left him and passed away, but he did not age. His dedication and piety unknowingly granted him eternal youth. Since he made no compromises with Time, Time avoided him, only sighing from afar, unable to defeat him. By the time he found the perfect stock, the city of Kouroo had become an ancient ruin. He sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he shaped it, the Candahar dynasty had ended, and he wrote the last ruler's name in the sand with the stick's point before continuing his work. By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff, the pole-star had changed, and Brahma had awoken and slept many times. When he finally finished, the staff transformed before his astonished eyes into the most beautiful of Brahma's creations. In making the staff, he had created a new system, a world with perfect proportions, where old cities and dynasties were replaced by even more magnificent ones. The pile of fresh shavings at his feet revealed that the passage of time had been an illusion, and no more time had passed than a single spark from Brahma's mind igniting a mortal's thoughts. With pure materials and pure art, the result could only be marvelous.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0022">No face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where we are, but in a false position. Through an infinity of our natures, we suppose a case, and put ourselves into it, and hence are in two cases at the same time, and it is doubly difficult to get out. In sane moments we regard only the facts, the case that is. Say what you have to say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe. Tom Hyde, the tinker, standing on the gallows, was asked if he had anything to say. “Tell the tailors,  said he, “to remember to make a knot in their thread before they take the first stitch.  His companion’s prayer is forgotten.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0022">No matter how we try to spin things, in the end, only the truth holds up. It's the only thing that lasts. Most of the time, we aren't being authentic, but rather putting on an act. We imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations, and in doing so, we end up in two places at once, making it twice as hard to escape. When we're thinking clearly, we focus solely on the facts of the actual situation. Say what you need to say, not what you think you should. Any truth, no matter how harsh, beats living a lie. When Tom Hyde, the tinker, was about to be hanged, they asked if he had any last words. "Remind the tailors," he said, "to tie a knot in their thread before starting to sew." No one remembers what his friend said.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0023">However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the rich man’s abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town’s poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. May be they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: “From an army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought.  Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and meanness gather around us, “and lo! creation widens to our view.  We are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Crœsus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0023">Don't shy away from your life, no matter how tough it seems. Face it head-on and live it fully. Things aren't as bad as you think. Life looks the worst when you have the most. Complainers will find issues with everything, even in heaven. Cherish your life, even if it's not perfect. You can have wonderful, exciting moments, even in poverty. The sun sets just as beautifully on a poor house as it does on a mansion. Snow melts just as early in spring at the doorstep of the needy. I believe a peaceful mind can live as happily in a poor house as in a castle. The poor in town often seem the most free to me. Perhaps they're simply wise enough to accept charity. Many think they're too good for public assistance, but it's more common that they're willing to resort to dishonest means to get by, which is far worse. Embrace poverty, like growing sage in your garden. Don't worry about acquiring new things, whether it's clothes or companions. Reuse what you have; go back to them. Things remain constant; it's we who change. Sell your clothes but keep your thoughts. God will provide you with all the company you need. Even if I was trapped in an attic all my life, like a spider, the world would still be vast as long as I had my thoughts. A philosopher once said: "You can take away a general from a three-part army and throw it into chaos, but you cannot take away a man's thoughts, no matter how lowly he is." Don't strive so hard to grow and be influenced by everything; it's all a waste. Humility, like darkness, reveals the lights of heaven. The shadows of poverty gather around us, "and behold! the world expands before our eyes." We're often reminded that even if we had all the riches in the world, our goals and means would essentially remain the same. Moreover, if your options are limited by poverty and you can't afford books or newspapers, you're forced to focus on the most meaningful and vital experiences. You have to work with what gives the most reward. That's when life is the sweetest, when you're closest to the core. It saves you from being frivolous. No one ever suffers by being generous, even in the face of less. Excess wealth can only buy excess things. Money isn't needed to acquire what's essential for the soul.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0024">I live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured a little alloy of bell metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches my ears a confused <i>tintinnabulum</i> from without. It is the noise of my contemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they met at the dinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in the contents of the Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are about costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress it as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of England and the Indies, of the Hon. Mr. —— of Georgia or of Massachusetts, all transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap from their court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my bearings,—not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but to walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may,—not to live in this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand or sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They are all on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody. God is only the president of the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully attracts me;—not hang by the beam of the scale and try to weigh less,—not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist me. It affords me no satisfaction to commence to spring an arch before I have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There is a solid bottom every where. We read that the traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that it had. But presently the traveller’s horse sank in up to the girths, and he observed to the boy, “I thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom.  “So it has,  answered the latter, “but you have not got half way to it yet.  So it is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said, or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the furring. Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work with satisfaction,—a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0024">I live in a corner of a lead wall, which has a small amount of bell metal mixed in. Often, during my midday rest, I hear a jumbled ringing sound from outside. It's the noise of the people around me. My neighbors talk about their experiences with well-known people, who they had dinner with, but I don't care about those things any more than I care about what's in the daily news. They mostly discuss fashion and behavior, but a goose is still a goose, no matter how you dress it up. They tell me about California, Texas, England, and the Indies, and different politicians, which are all short-lived things, until I feel like jumping out of their courtyard like the Mamluk leader. I love to find my place in the world, not marching in a flashy parade, but walking beside the Creator of the universe, if I can. I don't want to live in this anxious, hectic, petty 19th century, but to stand or sit and think as it passes by. What are people celebrating? They're all on a planning committee, constantly waiting for someone to give a speech. God is just the honorary leader, and some politician is his spokesperson. I love to ponder, to settle in, to be drawn to what pulls me most strongly and rightly, not to pretend I weigh less by hanging off the edge of the scale. I want to face reality, to walk the only path I can, the one where nothing can stop me. I don't like starting to build an arch before I have a solid base. Let's not mess around. There's always solid ground if you look for it. A traveler once asked a boy if the swamp ahead had a firm bottom, and the boy said it did. But soon the traveler's horse sank up to its belly in the muck. The traveler said, "I thought you told me this swamp had a hard bottom." The boy replied, "It does, but you're not even halfway there yet." Society is the same way, full of swamps and quicksand, but only a fool doesn't realize it. The only good things in life happen at rare, special moments. I don't want to be someone who foolishly hammers a nail into flimsy lath and plaster. That kind of thing would keep me up at night. Give me a hammer, and let me find the solid wood. Don't rely on weak putty. Hammer the nail in and bend it over so well that you can wake up at night and feel good about your work, something you wouldn't be ashamed to dedicate to the goddess of art and knowledge. That's the only way God will help you. Every nail you drive should be like another rivet in the machine of the universe, with you doing your part.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0025">Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the ices. I thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They talked to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I thought of an older, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious vintage, which they had not got, and could not buy. The style, the house and grounds and “entertainment  pass for nothing with me. I called on the king, but he made me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man incapacitated for hospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow tree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I called on him.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0025">Instead of love, money, or fame, I want the truth. I dined at a table overflowing with rich food, wine, and fawning service, but it lacked sincerity and honesty. I left the unwelcoming feast unsatisfied. The hospitality was as frigid as the ice, which seemed unnecessary to chill it further. They spoke of the wine's age and the vintage's renown, but I dreamed of an older, fresher, finer wine from a more splendid year that they neither possessed nor could afford. The fashion, estate, grounds and pageantry mean nothing to me. I visited the king, but he kept me waiting in his hall, behaving like one unfit for hosting guests. In my area lived a man in a hollow tree whose manners were truly majestic. I would have fared better calling upon him instead.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0026">How long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty virtues, which any work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin the day with long-suffering, and hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in the afternoon go forth to practise Christian meekness and charity with goodness aforethought! Consider the China pride and stagnant self-complacency of mankind. This generation inclines a little to congratulate itself on being the last of an illustrious line; and in Boston and London and Paris and Rome, thinking of its long descent, it speaks of its progress in art and science and literature with satisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and the public Eulogies of <i>Great Men!</i> It is the good Adam contemplating his own virtue. “Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs, which shall never die, —that is, as long as <i>we</i> can remember them. The learned societies and great men of Assyria,—where are they? What youthful philosophers and experimentalists we are! There is not one of my readers who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be but the spring months in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years’ itch, we have not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep nearly half our time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise, and have an established order on the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we are ambitious spirits! As I stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest floor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself why it will cherish those humble thoughts, and hide its head from me who might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some cheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and Intelligence that stands over me the human insect. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0026">How long will we sit on our porches practicing outdated virtues that any work would make irrelevant? It's as if we start the day with patience, hire someone to tend our crops, and then in the afternoon go out to practice kindness and generosity on purpose! Think about the pride and stagnation of humanity. This generation tends to pat itself on the back for being the last of a great line. In cities like Boston, London, Paris and Rome, reflecting on its history, it talks about its advancements in art, science and literature with pride. There are records from academic groups and public praise of famous people! It's like a content Adam admiring his own goodness. "Yes, we've done amazing things and created timeless art," meaning as long as we remember them. Where are the scholars and great men of Assyria now? We're such young thinkers and experimenters! None of my readers has even lived a full life yet. These may just be the early months in humanity's existence. If we've had the seven-year itch, we haven't seen the seventeen-year cicada in Concord yet. We're only familiar with the surface of the planet we inhabit. Most haven't dug six feet deep or jumped that high above it. We don't know our place. Plus, we're sound asleep for nearly half our time. Still, we consider ourselves wise and have an established order above ground. We really are deep thinkers and ambitious souls! When I look at a bug crawling in the pine needles on the forest floor, trying to hide from me, and wonder why it clings to such modest thoughts and hides from me, who could maybe help it and share some uplifting knowledge with its kind, I'm reminded of the greater Helper and Intellect that watches over me, the human bug.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0027">There is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we tolerate incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened to in the most enlightened countries. There are such words as joy and sorrow, but they are only the burden of a psalm, sung with a nasal twang, while we believe in the ordinary and mean. We think that we can change our clothes only. It is said that the British Empire is very large and respectable, and that the United States are a first-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he should ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year locust will next come out of the ground? The government of the world I live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine.</p>

I only need to mention the kinds of sermons people still listen to, even in the most advanced nations. Words like joy and sorrow exist, but they are reduced to lyrics in a droning hymn, while we settle for the mundane and average. We think we can only change superficial things. They say the British Empire is vast and esteemed, and that the United States is a top-tier nation. But we don't realize that there are powerful forces at work behind every person, forces that could sweep away even the mightiest of empires, if one truly believed in them. Who knows what unexpected events will emerge next? The way the world I inhabit is governed was not decided over wine at fancy dinner parties, as it was in Britain.</p>

It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer’s kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society’s most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!</p>

Its gnawing was heard for weeks, perhaps triggered by an urn's heat. Who doesn't feel their belief in resurrection and immortality grow upon hearing this? Who knows what lovely, winged life - its egg buried ages beneath layers of woodenness in society's dead, dry existence, first placed in the green, living tree's sapwood, slowly turned into its well-aged tomb - may one day unexpectedly emerge from society's most trivial, used furnishings to finally enjoy its perfect summer, after years of gnawing noticed by the surprised human family around the celebratory table!</p>
