In accumulating property for ourselves or our posterity, in founding a family or a state, or acquiring fame even, we are mortal; but in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor accident. The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a corner of the veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling robe remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it was I in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews the vision. No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since that divinity was revealed. That time which we really improve, or which is improvable, is neither past, present, nor future.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-w transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001">With more thought put into what they pursue, perhaps all people would become students and observers at heart, as everyone's nature and fate are equally fascinating. When gathering wealth for ourselves or our children, starting a family or country, or even gaining fame, we are only mortal. But in seeking truth, we become immortal, unafraid of change or chance. The first Egyptian or Indian philosopher lifted the veil covering the god's statue, and that trembling veil stays lifted. I see the same brilliant sight as he did, for I was within him when he bravely looked, and he is now within me as I recall the vision. No dust has gathered on the veil, and no time has passed since that god was uncovered. The time we truly use well, or that can be used well, is not the past, present, or future.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">My residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious reading, than a university; and though I was beyond the range of the ordinary circulating library, I had more than ever come within the influence of those books which circulate round the world, whose sentences were first written on bark, and are now merely copied from time to time on to linen paper. Says the poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast, “Being seated to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the liquor of the esoteric doctrines.  I kept Homer’s Iliad on my table through the summer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant labor with my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to hoe at the same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained myself by the prospect of such reading in future. I read one or two shallow books of travel in the intervals of my work, till that employment made me ashamed of myself, and I asked where it was then that <i>I</i> lived.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">My home was better suited for deep thinking and serious reading than a university. Although I couldn't access a typical library, I was more influenced than ever by timeless books, whose words were first carved on bark and now simply copied onto paper. The poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast said, “Being seated to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the liquor of the esoteric doctrines.  I kept the Iliad on my table all summer, glancing at its pages occasionally. At first, constant manual labor, as I had to finish my house and tend my beans, made further study impossible. Yet the promise of such future reading sustained me. In between work, I read a couple of superficial travel books, until this pastime made me feel ashamed and question where I was really living.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">The student may read Homer or Æschylus in the Greek without danger of dissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure emulate their heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The heroic books, even if printed in the character of our mother tongue, will always be in a language dead to degenerate times; and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line, conjecturing a larger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor and generosity we have. The modern cheap and fertile press, with all its translations, has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers of antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the letter in which they are printed as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense of youthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an ancient language, which are raised out of the trivialness of the street, to be perpetual suggestions and provocations. It is not in vain that the farmer remembers and repeats the few Latin words which he has heard. Men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at length make way for more modern and practical studies; but the adventurous student will always study classics, in whatever language they may be written and however ancient they may be. For what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the only oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most modern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as well omit to study Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written. It is not enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by which they are written, for there is a memorable interval between the spoken and the written language, the language heard and the language read. The one is commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost brutish, and we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our mothers. The other is the maturity and experience of that; if that is our mother tongue, this is our father tongue, a reserved and select expression, too significant to be heard by the ear, which we must be born again in order to speak. The crowds of men who merely <i>spoke</i> the Greek and Latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by the accident of birth to <i>read</i> the works of genius written in those languages; for these were not written in that Greek or Latin which they knew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned the nobler dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which they were written were waste paper to them, and they prized instead a cheap contemporary literature. But when the several nations of Europe had acquired distinct though rude written languages of their own, sufficient for the purposes of their rising literatures, then first learning revived, and scholars were enabled to discern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and Grecian multitude could not <i>hear</i>, after the lapse of ages a few scholars <i>read</i>, and a few scholars only are still reading it.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">The student can read Homer or Aeschylus in Greek without risk of indulgence or excess, as it suggests they somewhat emulate their heroes and dedicate mornings to their works. The heroic books, even if printed in our native language, will always be in a tongue dead to decadent times. We must diligently search for the meaning of each word and line, inferring a greater sense than common use allows from the wisdom, courage and generosity that we possess. The modern inexpensive and prolific press, with all its translations, has done little to bring us closer to the heroic writers of old. They seem as isolated, and the print they appear in is as rare and intriguing, as ever. It is worth the cost of youthful days and precious hours if you only learn a few words of an ancient language, which are elevated from the mundaneness of the street, to be eternal suggestions and provocations. It is not futile that the farmer recalls and repeats the few Latin words he has heard. People sometimes say that the study of the classics will eventually give way to more contemporary and practical pursuits, but the daring student will always study classics, no matter the language or age in which they are written. For what are the classics if not the noblest recorded thoughts of humankind? They are the only oracles that have not decayed, and they hold answers to the most current questions that Delphi and Dodona never provided. We might as well neglect to study Nature because she is ancient. To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will challenge the reader more than any activity esteemed by today's customs. It demands training like that of athletes, the steady dedication of nearly one's whole life to this purpose. Books must be read as thoughtfully and selectively as they were written. It is not sufficient even to be able to speak the language of the nation by which they are written, for there is a significant gap between the spoken and written word, the language heard and the language read. The former is usually fleeting, a sound, a tongue, a mere dialect, almost animalistic, and we acquire it unconsciously, like beasts, from our mothers. The latter is the maturity and refinement of that; if the former is our mother tongue, the latter is our father tongue, a reserved and chosen expression, too meaningful to be perceived by the ear, which we must be reborn to speak. The masses who merely spoke Greek and Latin in the Middle Ages were not entitled by the chance of birth to read the works of genius written in those languages, for these were not written in the Greek or Latin they knew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned the nobler dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which they were written were worthless to them, and they valued instead a cheap contemporary literature. But when the various nations of Europe had developed distinct though crude written languages of their own, adequate for the needs of their emerging literatures, then learning first revived, and scholars were able to discern from that distance the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and Greek multitudes could not hear, after ages had passed, a few scholars read, and only a few scholars are still reading it.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">However much we may admire the orator’s occasional bursts of eloquence, the noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the clouds. <i>There</i> are the stars, and they who can may read them. The astronomers forever comment on and observe them. They are not exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath. What is called eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the study. The orator yields to the inspiration of a transient occasion, and speaks to the mob before him, to those who can <i>hear</i> him; but the writer, whose more equable life is his occasion, and who would be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator, speaks to the intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age who can <i>understand</i> him.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">No matter how much we praise a speaker's moments of brilliance, the finest written words often surpass everyday speech like the starry sky towers above the clouds. The stars are there for those who can interpret them. Astronomers constantly study and remark on them. They are not fleeting like our daily conversations and breathy exchanges. What passes for eloquence in public is often exposed as mere rhetoric in private. The speaker is moved by a passing moment and talks to the crowd in front of him, to those within earshot; but the writer, whose steadier existence is his platform, and who would be sidetracked by the hubbub and audience that motivate the speaker, appeals to the minds and well-being of all people, to anyone in any era who can grasp his meaning.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">No wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions in a precious casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated into every language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lips;—not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an ancient man’s thought becomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand summers have imparted to the monuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a maturer golden and autumnal tint, for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect them against the corrosion of time. Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind. When the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion, he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves his good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that he becomes the founder of a family.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">It's no surprise that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his journeys in a precious box. The written word is the finest of relics. It is at once more personal to us and more universal than any other art form. It is the art closest to life itself. It can be translated into every language, and not only read but truly spoken from all human lips—not just shown on canvas or in stone, but carved out of the breath of life. The symbol of an ancient person's thought becomes a modern person's speech. Two thousand summers have given Greek literature and sculptures only a richer golden and autumn color, as they have brought their own calm and heavenly air to all lands to guard them against the decay of time. Books are the world's cherished wealth and the proper legacy of generations and nations. The oldest and best books belong naturally and rightfully on every home's shelves. They need no special argument, but while they inform and support the reader, common sense will embrace them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible upper class in every society, wielding more influence on humanity than kings or emperors. When the uneducated and maybe scornful merchant has gained his desired free time and independence through hard work and business, and is welcomed into the circles of wealth and style, he inevitably turns at last to those even higher but still unreachable circles of intellect and genius, and feels deeply the limits of his knowledge and the emptiness and inadequacy of all his wealth, and further shows his good judgment by the effort he puts into securing for his children the intellectual education whose lack he so strongly senses; and so he becomes the founder of a family.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">Those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been made into any modern tongue, unless our civilization itself may be regarded as such a transcript. Homer has never yet been printed in English, nor Æschylus, nor Virgil even—works as refined, as solidly done, and as beautiful almost as the morning itself; for later writers, say what we will of their genius, have rarely, if ever, equalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroic literary labors of the ancients. They only talk of forgetting them who never knew them. It will be soon enough to forget them when we have the learning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and appreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which we call Classics, and the still older and more than classic but even less known Scriptures of the nations, shall have still further accumulated, when the Vaticans shall be filled with Vedas and Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and Shakespeares, and all the centuries to come shall have successively deposited their trophies in the forum of the world. By such a pile we may hope to scale heaven at last.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006">Those who haven't read the old classics in their original language must have an incomplete understanding of human history. Remarkably, no translation of them has been made into any modern language, unless our civilization itself is considered such a translation. Homer, Aeschylus, and Virgil have never been fully printed in English—works as polished, solid, and beautiful as the morning itself. Later writers, despite their genius, have rarely matched the detailed beauty, finish, and lifelong heroic literary efforts of the ancients. Only those who never knew them talk of forgetting them. We will be ready to forget them when we have the knowledge and talent to fully appreciate them. That era will be truly rich when those relics we call Classics, and the even older and lesser known Scriptures of nations, have further accumulated. When the Vaticans are filled with Vedas, Zendavestas, Bibles, Homers, Dantes and Shakespeares, and all the coming centuries have added their prizes in the world's forum. With such a collection, we may finally reach heaven.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">The works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for only great poets can read them. They have only been read as the multitude read the stars, at most astrologically, not astronomically. Most men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience, as they have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated in trade; but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know little or nothing; yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and devote our most alert and wakeful hours to. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">The writings of brilliant poets have never truly been understood by humanity, as only great poets themselves can comprehend them. Most people have read them superficially, like glancing at the stars for astrological purposes rather than studying them astronomically. The majority have learned to read for practical reasons, just as they've learned basic math to balance their books and avoid being swindled. However, they know little of reading as a lofty mental pursuit. True reading, in the highest sense, is not a relaxing indulgence that lets the mind wander. Instead, it requires us to be fully engaged, on our toes, devoting our sharpest and most attentive hours to the task.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in literature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs, and words of one syllable, in the fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost form all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or hear read, and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book, the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their faculties in what is called easy reading. There is a work in several volumes in our Circulating Library entitled Little Reading, which I thought referred to a town of that name which I had not been to. There are those who, like cormorants and ostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables, for they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to provide this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read the nine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sephronia, and how they loved as none had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true love run smooth,—at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get up again and go on! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who had better never have gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having needlessly got him up there, the happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear, O dear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that they had better metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weathercocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them swing round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother honest men with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will not stir though the meeting-house burn down. “The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by the celebrated author of ‘Tittle-Tol-Tan,’ to appear in monthly parts; a great rush; don’t all come together.  All this they read with saucer eyes, and erect and primitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations even yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher his two-cent gilt-covered edition of Cinderella,—without any improvement, that I can see, in the pronunciation, or accent, or emphasis, or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral. The result is dulness of sight, a stagnation of the vital circulations, and a general deliquium and sloughing off of all the intellectual faculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked daily and more sedulously than pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and finds a surer market.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">After learning to read, we should explore the best literature available, not spend our lives stuck on basic texts. Many people are content to read just one meaningful book, like the Bible, and then waste time on trivial reading. Our library has a series called "Little Reading," which I initially thought was about a town I hadn't visited. Some people can consume all kinds of light material, even after a full meal, as if they're determined not to waste anything. If others produce this content, these readers are the machines that consume it. They read countless stories about characters like Zebulon and Sephronia, whose love story is always described as unique, though it follows the same predictable path of ups and downs. These tales often involve pointless scenarios, like someone climbing a steeple for no good reason, only for the author to dramatically describe how they got down, as if it's a momentous event worth everyone's attention. I think these wannabe heroes from popular novels should be turned into weathervanes, like ancient heroes were made into constellations. Let them spin up there until they rust, instead of bothering regular folks with their antics. Next time an author tries to grab our attention, I won't budge, even if the whole place is on fire. You see ads like, "The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop, a Medieval Romance by the famous author of 'Tittle-Tol-Tan,' coming out monthly. Don't miss it!" People read this stuff wide-eyed and eager, their minds never tiring, just like a little kid reading a cheap Cinderella book. But they don't improve their reading skills or ability to understand the story's message. The result? Dull vision, sluggish thinking, and a general decline in mental sharpness. This kind of mindless entertainment is churned out more often than wholesome content, and it sells better too.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers. What does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in English literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the college-bred and so called liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts any where made to become acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to “keep himself in practice,  he being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred generally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the purpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best English books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar even to the so called illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have had a scripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a silver dollar; but here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us of;—and yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when we leave school, the “Little Reading,  and story books, which are for boys and beginners; and our reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies and manikins.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">The best books are not read even by those considered good readers. What does our Concord culture really mean? In this town, with very few exceptions, there is no appreciation for the best or even very good books in English literature, which everyone can read and understand. Even college-educated and supposedly well-read people here and elsewhere have little to no familiarity with English classics. As for the recorded wisdom of humanity, the ancient classics and sacred texts, which are available to all who seek them, efforts to engage with them are extremely weak. I know a middle-aged woodchopper, a Canadian by birth, who reads a French newspaper not for news, as he's above that, but to "keep himself in practice". When I ask him the best thing he can do in this world, besides this, he says to maintain and improve his English. This is about as much as most college graduates do or aim for, taking an English paper for that purpose. If someone has just finished reading one of the best English books, how many people can they discuss it with? Or if they've read a Greek or Latin classic in the original, praised even by the "uneducated," they'll find no one to talk to and must stay silent. In fact, hardly any college professor, even if they've mastered the language, has equally grasped the wit and poetry of a Greek poet and can share insights with an eager and heroic reader. As for the sacred scriptures, or Bibles of humanity, who in this town can even name them? Most don't know any nation besides the Hebrews had scriptures. A man will go out of his way for a silver dollar, but here are golden words, spoken by antiquity's wisest and affirmed by the wise of every age since—yet we only learn to read primers and textbooks, and upon leaving school, just "light reading" and children's stories. Our reading, conversation, and thinking are on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies and small beings.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has produced, whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name of Plato and never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I never saw him,—my next neighbor and I never heard him speak or attended to the wisdom of his words. But how actually is it? His Dialogues, which contain what was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet I never read them. We are underbred and low-lived and illiterate; and in this respect I confess I do not make any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all, and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is for children and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the worthies of antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a race of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights than the columns of the daily paper.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">I want to know wiser people than those from Concord, whose names are barely known here. How can I hear of Plato but never read his work? As if he were my neighbor and I never saw or listened to his wisdom. But what's the reality? His Dialogues, containing his immortal thoughts, are right nearby, yet I've never read them. We are uneducated, low-class, and illiterate; I see little difference between my neighbor who can't read at all, and one who only reads children's books and simple material. We should be as great as historical figures, but first we must know their greatness. We are small-minded, rarely rising above the daily news in our thinking.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">It is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are probably words addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and understand, would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives, and possibly put a new aspect on the face of things for us. How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book. The book exists for us perchance which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his ability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall learn liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of Concord, who has had his second birth and peculiar religious experience, and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith, may think it is not true; but Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the same experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and established worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with Jesus Christ himself, and let “our church  go by the board.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">Not all books are as boring as their readers. There are likely words that speak directly to our situation, which, if we could truly hear and understand them, would be more beneficial than the morning or spring to our lives, and possibly give us a new perspective. Many people have started a new chapter in their lives after reading a book. Perhaps there is a book out there that will explain our wonders and uncover new ones. We may find the currently unspeakable things expressed somewhere. These same issues that trouble, baffle and bewilder us have been encountered by all the wise people; not a single one has been left out; and each has responded to them, based on their capability, through their words and actions. Furthermore, with wisdom, we will learn open-mindedness. The lone hired hand on a farm on the edge of Concord, who has experienced a spiritual rebirth and unique religious awakening, and believes he is compelled into a solemn seriousness and isolation by his beliefs, may think it is false; but Zoroaster, millennia ago, walked the same path and had the same experience; however, being wise, he recognized it as universal, and treated his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have created and established worship among people. Let him humbly connect with Zoroaster then, and through the broadening impact of all the greats, with Jesus Christ himself, and let "our church" be set aside.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">We boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the most rapid strides of any nation. But consider how little this village does for its own culture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for that will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked,—goaded like oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the state, no school for ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure—if they are indeed so well off—to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school too long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the village should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the nineteenth century, why should we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth century offers? Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral family  papers, or browsing “Olive-Branches  here in New England. Let the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if they know any thing. Why should we leave it to Harper &amp; Brothers and Redding &amp; Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his culture,—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music— philosophical instruments, and the like; so let the village do,—not stop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen, because our pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these. To act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than the nobleman’s. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be provincial at all. That is the <i>uncommon</i> school we want. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012">We pride ourselves on being a part of the 19th century and making the fastest progress of any nation. But think about how little this town does for its own development. I don't want to praise or be praised by my fellow citizens, as that won't help either of us. We need to be pushed and prodded like oxen into action. We have a fairly good system of common schools for young children, but besides the underfunded Lyceum in winter and the recent tiny start of a state-suggested library, there's no school for adults. We spend more on nearly any type of food or treatment for the body than we do for the mind. It's time we had special schools so our education doesn't stop when we become adults. It's time for towns to be universities, with older residents as the scholars, having the free time—if they are truly so well off—to study the liberal arts for the rest of their lives. Must the world be limited to just Paris or Oxford forever? Can't students live here and get a well-rounded education in Concord? Can't we hire an Abelard-like teacher for us? Unfortunately, between feeding livestock and running shops, we're kept out of school too long, and our education is badly neglected. In this country, the town should in some ways take the place of the European nobleman. It should support the fine arts. It's wealthy enough. It only lacks the generosity and culture. It can afford to spend on things farmers and merchants value, but it's seen as unrealistic to suggest spending on things that more knowledgeable people know are far more valuable. This town spent $17,000 on a town hall, thanks to luck or politics, but likely won't spend that much in a century on living knowledge to fill that building. The $125 per year for a winter Lyceum is better spent than any other equal amount raised here. If we live in the 19th century, why not take advantage of what it offers? Why should our life be at all provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral family  papers, or browsing “Olive-Branches  here in New England. Let us see reports from all the academic societies, and find out if they know anything. Why leave it to publishers to choose our reading? As the cultured nobleman surrounds himself with all that improves his refinement—genius, learning, wit, books, art, statues, music, academic tools, and such—so should the town, not settling for just a teacher, minister, caretaker, local library and three officials, just because our Pilgrim ancestors survived a harsh winter on a barren rock with those. Acting together fits our national spirit, and I'm sure that as our situation improves, our resources exceed the nobleman's. New England can employ all the world's wise ones to come instruct her and can host them and not be provincial at all. That's the exceptional school we need. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble towns of people. If needed, leave out one bridge over the river, go around a bit, and build at least one arch over the darker chasm of ignorance around us.</p>
