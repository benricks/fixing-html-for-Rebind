But such was not the effect on Walden that year, for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old. This pond never breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never knew it to open in the course of a winter, not excepting that of ’52–3, which gave the ponds so severe a trial. It commonly opens about the first of April, a week or ten days later than Flint’s Pond and Fair-Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of the season, being least affected by transient changes of temperature. A severe cold of a few days’ duration in March may very much retard the opening of the former ponds, while the temperature of Walden increases almost uninterruptedly. A thermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the 6th of March, 1847, stood at 32°, or freezing point; near the shore at 33°; in the middle of Flint’s Pond, the same day, at 32½°; at a dozen rods from the shore, in shallow water, under ice a foot thick, at 36°. This difference of three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the middle. In mid-winter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore, where only three or four inches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface where it is deep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth, but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water, and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice, at the same time that it is melting it more directly above, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot or “comb,  that is, assume the appearance of honey-comb, whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by this reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.</p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-t transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001">The opening of large areas by ice-cutters often causes a pond to thaw earlier. The water, stirred by the wind even in cold weather, erodes the surrounding ice. But this did not happen to Walden that year, as it soon got a thick new coat to replace the old one. This pond never thaws as early as others nearby, due to its greater depth and lack of a stream flowing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never saw it open during winter, not even in '52-3, which tested the ponds severely. It usually opens around April 1, a week or ten days after Flint's Pond and Fair-Haven, starting to melt on the north side and in shallower parts where it first froze. It shows the absolute progress of the season better than any water around here, being least affected by brief temperature changes. A severe cold spell in March may greatly delay the opening of the other ponds, while Walden's temperature rises almost steadily. A thermometer placed in the middle of Walden on March 6, 1847, read 32°F, or freezing point; near the shore it was 33°F. In the middle of Flint's Pond that same day, it was 32.5°F; a dozen rods from shore, in shallow water under a foot of ice, it was 36°F. This 3.5-degree difference between the deep and shallow water temperatures in Flint's Pond, and the fact that much of it is relatively shallow, explains why it thaws so much sooner than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was several inches thinner than in the middle at this time. In mid-winter, the middle had been the warmest with the thinnest ice. Also, anyone who has waded near the pond's shores in summer must have noticed how much warmer the water is close to shore, where it's only three to four inches deep a little way out, and warmer on the surface in deep areas than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only influences the air and earth temperature, but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick. It reflects off the bottom in shallow water, warming the water and melting the underside of the ice, while also melting it more directly from above. This makes the ice uneven and causes its air bubbles to expand up and down until it's completely honeycombed. It then suddenly disappears in a single spring rain. Ice has a grain like wood does, and when a piece starts to rot or "comb"—take on a honeycomb look—the air cells are perpendicular to what was the water's surface, regardless of the ice's position. The ice is much thinner and often completely melted over a rock or log near the surface, due to this reflected heat. I've heard that in the Cambridge experiment to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond, the sun's reflection off the bottom more than offset the advantage of cold air circulating underneath with access to both sides. When a warm winter rain melts the snow-ice off of Walden, leaving hard dark, or clear ice in the middle, there will be a strip of rotten but thicker white ice about a rod wide along the shores, created by this reflected heat. Also, as I mentioned, the bubbles themselves within the ice act as burning glasses to melt the ice beneath them.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">The phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale. Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the deep, though it may not be made so warm after all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter, the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the summer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night, February 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint’s Pond to spend the day, I noticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a tight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise, when it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over the hills; it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In the right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity. But in the middle of the day, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it had completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say that the “thundering of the pond  scares the fishes and prevents their biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no difference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillæ. The largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its tube.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">The events of the year happen daily on a smaller scale in a pond. In the morning, shallow water usually warms up faster than deep water, even if it doesn't get as warm in the end. Every evening, it cools more quickly until morning. The day represents the whole year. Night is like winter, morning and evening are like spring and fall, and noon is summer. Cracking and booming ice signals a temperature change. One nice morning after a cold night on February 24, 1850, I went to Flint's Pond for the day. I was surprised when I hit the ice with my ax—it sounded like a gong or tight drum, echoing for many yards. The pond started rumbling about an hour after dawn, as sunlight began to warm it from across the hills. It seemed to stretch and yawn like someone waking up, with a slowly growing noise that lasted for several hours. Around midday, the pond quieted briefly, then rumbled again as evening approached and the sun's heat faded. In the right weather conditions, the pond would make a loud sound each evening, like clockwork. However, during the hottest part of the day, when the pond’s surface was full of cracks and the air was thinner, it lost its ability to make noise. At those times, even hitting the surface probably wouldn't have stunned fish or muskrats. Fishermen claim that the lake's "thundering" frightens fish and stops them from biting. The pond doesn't make this sound every night, and I can't predict when it will happen. Even when I don't notice any change in the weather, the pond seems to know when to rumble. The earth is alive and covered in bumps. Even the biggest pond is as sensitive to air changes as mercury in a thermometer.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">One attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have leisure and opportunity to see the spring come in. The ice in the pond at length begins to be honey-combed, and I can set my heel in it as I walk. Fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow; the days have grown sensibly longer; and I see how I shall get through the winter without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires are no longer necessary. I am on the alert for the first signs of spring, to hear the chance note of some arriving bird, or the striped squirrel’s chirp, for his stores must be now nearly exhausted, or see the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of March, after I had heard the bluebird, song-sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was still nearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the water, nor broken up and floated off as in rivers, but, though it was completely melted for half a rod in width about the shore, the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated with water, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches thick; but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a warm rain followed by fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with the fog, spirited away. One year I went across the middle only five days before it disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first completely open on the 1st of April; in ’46, the 25th of March; in ’47, the 8th of April; in ’51, the 28th of March; in ’52, the 18th of April; in ’53, the 23d of March; in ’54, about the 7th of April.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">One reason I wanted to live in the woods was to have the time and chance to see spring arrive. The pond ice finally starts to get honeycomb-like, and I can step through it as I walk. Fog, rain, and warmer sun slowly melt the snow; the days have gotten noticeably longer; and I see how I'll make it through winter without needing to add to my woodpile since big fires are no longer needed. I'm on the lookout for the first signs of spring—to hear the occasional call of a returning bird, or the striped squirrel's chirping, as his food stores must be almost gone by now, or to see the groundhog come out of his winter den. On March 13, after I had heard the bluebird, song sparrow, and red-winged blackbird, the ice was still nearly a foot thick. As it got warmer, the water didn't visibly erode the ice, or break it up and float it away like in rivers, but, although it was fully melted for a half-rod width along the shore, the middle was just honeycombed and soaked with water, so you could step through six-inch thick ice; but by the next evening, maybe after a warm rain and fog, it would have vanished completely, gone with the fog, as if by magic. One year I crossed the middle just five days before it totally disappeared. In 1845 Walden opened up fully on April 1; in '46, March 25; in '47, April 8; in '51, March 28; in '52, April 18; in '53, March 23; in '54, around April 7.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds and the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who live in a climate of so great extremes. When the warmer days come, they who dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startling whoop as loud as artillery, as if its icy fetters were rent from end to end, and within a few days see it rapidly going out. So the alligator comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth. One old man, who has been a close observer of Nature, and seems as thoroughly wise in regard to all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when he was a boy, and he had helped to lay her keel,—who has come to his growth, and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live to the age of Methuselah,—told me, and I was surprised to hear him express wonder at any of Nature’s operations, for I thought that there were no secrets between them, that one spring day he took his gun and boat, and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks. There was ice still on the meadows, but it was all gone out of the river, and he dropped down without obstruction from Sudbury, where he lived, to Fair-Haven Pond, which he found, unexpectedly, covered for the most part with a firm field of ice. It was a warm day, and he was surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing any ducks, he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the pond, and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side, to await them. The ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore, and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water, with a muddy bottom, such as the ducks love, within, and he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon. After he had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound, but singularly grand and impressive, unlike any thing he had ever heard, gradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending, a sullen rush and roar, which seemed to him all at once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there, and, seizing his gun, he started up in haste and excited; but he found, to his surprise, that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there, and drifted in to the shore, and the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on the shore,—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off, but at length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a stand still.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">When warmer days arrive, those living near rivers hear the ice cracking loudly at night, sounding like artillery fire as the icy chains break apart. Within days, the ice quickly disappears. Similarly, alligators emerge from the mud, shaking the earth. One wise old man, a keen observer of nature who seems to know all her secrets, told me a surprising story. One spring day, he took his gun and boat for some duck hunting. Ice still covered the meadows, but the river was clear. He easily made his way to Fair-Haven Pond, which he unexpectedly found mostly frozen over despite the warm day. Seeing no ducks, he hid his boat on the north side of an island and concealed himself in the bushes on the south side to wait. The ice had melted for a short distance from the shore, creating a smooth, warm sheet of water with a muddy bottom that ducks love. He thought some would arrive soon. After waiting silently for about an hour, he heard a low, distant sound that was uniquely grand and impressive. It gradually swelled and grew, as if leading to a momentous ending—a deep rush and roar that suddenly sounded to him like a huge flock of birds coming to land. Seizing his gun, he jumped up hastily, excited. But to his surprise, he discovered that the entire ice sheet had begun moving while he lay there. It drifted to the shore, and the sound he heard was its edge scraping against the land. At first, it gently nibbled and crumbled, but eventually, it heaved up and scattered debris along the island to a significant height before finally coming to rest.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">At length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds blow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks, and the sun dispersing the mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense, through which the traveller picks his way from islet to islet, cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">Finally, the sun's beams reach the perfect angle, and warm breezes bring fog, rain, and melting snow. The sun breaks through the haze and shines on a patchwork of brown and white earth, steaming with fragrance. The traveler makes their way from one small patch of dry land to another, delighted by the sound of countless bubbling streams and small rivers. These waterways flow with the essence of winter, carrying it away.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">Few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through which I passed on my way to the village, a phenomenon not very common on so large a scale, though the number of freshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly multiplied since railroads were invented. The material was sand of every degree of fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed with a little clay. When the frost comes out in the spring, and even in a thawing day in the winter, the sand begins to flow down the slopes like lava, sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it where no sand was to be seen before. Innumerable little streams overlap and interlace one with another, exhibiting a sort of hybrid product, which obeys half way the law of currents, and half way that of vegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vines, making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth, and resembling, as you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and imbricated thalluses of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of leopard’s paws or birds’ feet, of brains or lungs or bowels, and excrements of all kinds. It is a truly <i>grotesque</i> vegetation, whose forms and color we see imitated in bronze, a sort of architectural foliage more ancient and typical than acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine, or any vegetable leaves; destined perhaps, under some circumstances, to become a puzzle to future geologists. The whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave with its stalactites laid open to the light. The various shades of the sand are singularly rich and agreeable, embracing the different iron colors, brown, gray, yellowish, and reddish. When the flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into <i>strands</i>, the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form and gradually becoming more flat and broad, running together as they are more moist, till they form an almost flat <i>sand</i>, still variously and beautifully shaded, but in which you can trace the original forms of vegetation; till at length, in the water itself, they are converted into <i>banks</i>, like those formed off the mouths of rivers, and the forms of vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006">Few things delighted me more than seeing the shapes that thawing sand and clay take as they flow down the sides of a deep railroad cut I passed on my way to town. This isn't a common sight on such a large scale, though there must be many more freshly exposed banks of the right material since railroads were invented. The material was sand of various degrees of fineness and rich colors, usually mixed with a bit of clay. When the frost thaws in spring, and even on a warm winter day, the sand starts flowing down the slopes like lava, sometimes bursting through the snow and covering areas where no sand was visible before. Countless tiny streams overlap and intertwine, creating a kind of hybrid product that follows the laws of both currents and plants. As it flows, it forms shapes like juicy leaves or vines, making foot-deep piles of pulpy sprays. Looking down, they resemble the lobed and layered bodies of some lichens. They remind you of coral, animal paws or feet, brains, lungs, guts, and all sorts of waste. It's a truly bizarre vegetation, with shapes and colors imitated in bronze—a kind of architectural foliage more ancient and typical than acanthus, chicory, ivy, or vine leaves. It may someday become a puzzle for future geologists. The whole cut struck me as a cave with its stalactites exposed to light. The various shades of sand are remarkably rich and pleasant, including different iron colors like brown, gray, yellow, and red. When the flowing mass reaches the drain at the bottom of the bank, it spreads out flatter into strands. The individual streams lose their semi-cylindrical shape, gradually becoming flatter and wider. They run together as they get wetter, forming an almost flat sand that's still beautifully shaded in various ways. But you can still make out the original plant-like forms until, in the water itself, they turn into banks like those formed off river mouths, and the plant shapes are lost in the ripples on the bottom.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">The whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides, the produce of one spring day. What makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence thus suddenly. When I see on the one side the inert bank,—for the sun acts on one side first,—and on the other this luxuriant foliage, the creation of an hour, I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in the laboratory of the Artist who made the world and me,—had come to where he was still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs about. I feel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe, for this sandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body. You find thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No wonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea inwardly. The atoms have already learned this law, and are pregnant by it. The overhanging leaf sees here its prototype. <i>Internally</i>, whether in the globe or animal body, it is a moist thick <i>lobe</i>, a word especially applicable to the liver and lungs and the <i>leaves</i> of fat, (?e?ß?, <i>labor</i>, <i>lapsus</i>, to flow or slip downward, a lapsing; ??ß??, <i>globus</i>, lobe, globe; also lap, flap, and many other words,) <i>externally</i> a dry thin <i>leaf</i>, even as the <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> are a pressed and dried <i>b</i>. The radicals of <i>lobe</i> are <i>lb</i>, the soft mass of the <i>b</i> (single lobed, or B, double lobed,) with the liquid <i>l</i> behind it pressing it forward. In globe, <i>glb</i>, the guttural <i>g</i> adds to the meaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and wings of birds are still drier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you pass from the lumpish grub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly. The very globe continually transcends and translates itself, and becomes winged in its orbit. Even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves, as if it had flowed into moulds which the fronds of water plants have impressed on the watery mirror. The whole tree itself is but one leaf, and rivers are still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth, and towns and cities are the ova of insects in their axils. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">The entire bank, which stands twenty to forty feet tall, is sometimes covered with a mass of sandy foliage, stretching for a quarter mile on one or both sides, all from a single spring day. What's remarkable about this sand foliage is how suddenly it springs to life. When I see the lifeless bank on one side (the sun hits there first) and then this lush greenery on the other, an hour's creation, I feel like I'm in the studio of the Artist who made the world and me. It's as if I've stumbled upon His active workplace, where He playfully scatters His fresh designs. I feel a deeper connection to the planet's center, as this stretch of sand reminds me of an animal's internal organs. The earth seems to put a lot of effort into creating leaves, showing this idea clearly in the sand. Even the smallest particles seem to understand and embody this concept. A leaf on a tree can see its beginnings here. Whether inside the earth or an animal, it takes the form of a damp, dense mass (similar to organs like the liver and lungs, as well as fat, and sharing roots with words like "labor," "lapse," "slip," "globe," "lap," and "flap"). Outside it's a dry thin leaf, much like f and v are squashed, dried versions of b. Lobe's roots are l b, the b's soft mass (single or double-lobed), propelled by liquid l. In globe (glb), the throaty g suggests the throat's capacity. Bird feathers and wings are even drier, with thinner leaves. And so you go from the lumpy grub in the soil to the light, fluttering butterfly. The globe itself constantly transcends and translates itself, becoming winged in its orbit. Even ice starts with fine crystal leaves as if poured into molds left by water plant fronds on the pond's mirror. The whole tree is just one big leaf, and rivers are even larger leaves with soil between, while towns and cities are insect eggs nestled in their axils.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">When the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow, but in the morning the streams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad of others. You here see perchance how blood vessels are formed. If you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows, using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its channel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the silicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system, and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue. What is man but a mass of thawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but a drop congealed. The fingers and toes flow to their extent from the thawing mass of the body. Who knows what the human body would expand and flow out to under a more genial heaven? Is not the hand a spreading <i>palm</i> leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be regarded, fancifully, as a lichen, <i>umbilicaria</i>, on the side of the head, with its lobe or drop. The lip—<i>labium</i>, from <i>labor</i> (?)—laps or lapses from the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a manifest congealed drop or stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the confluent dripping of the face. The cheeks are a slide from the brows into the valley of the face, opposed and diffused by the cheek bones. Each rounded lobe of the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering drop, larger or smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as many lobes as it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more heat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yet farther.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">When the sun sets, the sand stops flowing, but in the morning, the streams start again, branching into countless others. Perhaps this is how blood vessels form. If you look closely, you'll see that first a stream of soft sand pushes forward with a fingertip-like point, feeling its way slowly downward. As the sun rises and provides more heat and moisture, the most fluid part separates from the rest in an effort to obey the law that even the most inert yields to. It forms a winding channel or artery, in which a small, silvery stream glances like lightning from one stage of soft leaves or branches to another, occasionally disappearing into the sand. It's amazing how quickly yet flawlessly the sand organizes itself as it flows, using the best material to shape the sharp edges of its channel. These are the origins of rivers. The silica deposited by the water may be the bony system, and the finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fiber or cellular tissue. Isn't man just a mass of melting clay? The human fingertip is merely a congealed drop. The fingers and toes extend from the thawing body. Who knows how the human form would expand and flow under a more favorable environment? Isn't the hand a spreading palm leaf with its lobes and veins? One might imaginatively view the ear as a lichen or umbilicaria on the side of the head, with its lobe or drop. The lip—labium, from labor?—laps or lapses from the mouth's sides. The nose is clearly a solidified drop or stalactite. The chin is an even bigger drop, the face's confluent dripping. The cheeks slope from the brows into the valley of the face, diffused by the cheekbones. Each rounded lobe of a plant's leaf is also a thick, lingering drop, bigger or smaller; the lobes are the leaf's fingers. The leaf tends to flow in as many directions as it has lobes, and more heat or favorable conditions would have made it flow even farther.</p>

The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf. What Champollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us, that we may turn over a new leaf at last? This phenomenon is more exhilarating to me than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards. True, it is somewhat excrementitious in its character, and there is no end to the heaps of liver lights and bowels, as if the globe were turned wrong side outward; but this suggests at least that Nature has some bowels, and there again is mother of humanity. This is the frost coming out of the ground; this is Spring. It precedes the green and flowery spring, as mythology precedes regular poetry. I know of nothing more purgative of winter fumes and indigestions. It convinces me that Earth is still in her swaddling clothes, and stretches forth baby fingers on every side. Fresh curls spring from the baldest brow. There is nothing inorganic. These foliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnace, showing that Nature is “in full blast  within. The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not a fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic. Its throes will heave our exuviæ from their graves. You may melt your metals and cast them into the most beautiful moulds you can; they will never excite me like the forms which this molten earth flows out into. And not only it, but the institutions upon it, are plastic like clay in the hands of the potter. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">This single hillside seemed to demonstrate how all of Nature works. The Creator of the Earth simply used the same leaf design over and over. We need someone to decipher this hidden message for us so we can finally turn to a new way of understanding. This sight is more exciting to me than lush, fertile vineyards. It's a bit crude, with piles of guts and innards everywhere as if the world was turned inside out. But it shows that Nature has depth, and there lies the origin of humanity. This is the frost thawing from the ground; this is Spring. It comes before the verdant, blossoming spring, just as mythology precedes formal poetry. I know of nothing better for clearing out the staleness and overindulgence of winter. It proves to me that the Earth is still in its infancy, reaching out with tiny fingers in every direction. Even the baldest head sprouts fresh curls. Nothing is truly lifeless. These leaf-like piles along the bank are like the waste from a furnace, evidence that Nature is in peak production mode. The earth isn't just a dead historical record, layers upon layers like pages in a book for geologists and historians to examine. It's living poetry, like tree leaves before flowers and fruit—not a petrified earth, but a vibrant one. Compared to its immense, central life force, all plant and animal life is simply along for the ride. Its upheavals will expose our remains. You can melt your metals and pour them into the most beautiful molds, but they'll never fascinate me like the shapes this molten earth flows into. And it's not just the earth—the institutions built upon it are malleable too, like clay in a potter's hands.</p>

Thaw with his gentle persuasion is more powerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other but breaks in pieces.</p>

I am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the wool-grass; it brings back the summer to our winter memories, and is among the forms which art loves to copy, and which, in the vegetable kingdom, have the same relation to types already in the mind of man that astronomy has. It is an antique style older than Greek or Egyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of an inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to hear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the gentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of Summer.</p>

No you don’t—chickaree—chickaree. They were wholly deaf to my arguments, or failed to perceive their force, and fell into a strain of invective that was irresistible.</p>

The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red-wing, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell! What at such a time are histories, chronologies, traditions, and all written revelations? The brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The marsh-hawk sailing low over the meadow is already seeking the first slimy life that awakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and the ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire,—“et primitus oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocata, —as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its flame;—the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon, streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but anon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year’s hay with the fresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground. It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of June, when the rills are dry, the grass blades are their channels, and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply.

There is a canal two rods wide along the northerly and westerly sides, and wider still at the east end. A great field of ice has cracked off from the main body. I hear a song-sparrow singing from the bushes on the shore,—<i>olit</i>, <i>olit</i>, <i>olit,</i>—<i>chip</i>, <i>chip</i>, <i>chip</i>, <i>che char</i>,—<i>che wiss</i>, <i>wiss</i>, <i>wiss</i>. He too is helping to crack it. How handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge of the ice, answering somewhat to those of the shore, but more regular! It is unusually hard, owing to the recent severe but transient cold, and all watered or waved like a palace floor. But the wind slides eastward over its opaque surface in vain, till it reaches the living surface beyond. It is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling in the sun, the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth, as if it spoke the joy of the fishes within it, and of the sands on its shore,—a silvery sheen as from the scales of a <i>leuciscus</i>, as it were all one active fish. Such is the contrast between winter and spring. Walden was dead and is alive again. But this spring it broke up more steadily, as I have said. </p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">The change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark and sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last. Suddenly an influx of light filled my house, though the evening was at hand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain. I looked out the window, and lo! where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had intelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance, the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not forget for many a thousand more,—the same sweet and powerful song as of yore. O the evening robin, at the end of a New England summer day! If I could ever find the twig he sits upon! I mean <i>he</i>; I mean <i>the twig</i>. This at least is not the <i>Turdus migratorius</i>. The pitch-pines and shrub-oaks about my house, which had so long drooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter, greener, and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain any more. You may tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very wood-pile, whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled by the <i>honking</i> of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers getting in late from southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I could hear the rush of their wings; when, driving toward my house, they suddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first spring night in the woods. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0015">The shift from stormy winter to calm, mild weather, from dark, slow hours to bright, lively ones, is a significant change that everything announces. It seems sudden in the end. All at once, light flooded my house, even though evening approached and winter clouds still hung overhead, with icy rain dripping from the eaves. I peered out the window and behold! Where cold gray ice lay yesterday, there was now a clear pond, already serene and hopeful like on a summer evening, mirroring a summer night sky in its heart, as if connected to some far-off horizon. I heard a distant robin, the first in what felt like ages, its unforgettable song just as sweet and strong as before. Oh, the evening robin at dusk of a New England summer day! If only I could find the branch it perches on! The pines and oaks around my home, drooping for so long, quickly regained their unique qualities, appearing brighter, greener, more upright, and vibrant, as if thoroughly washed and revived by the rain. I sensed the rain had ceased for good. A glance at any forest twig, or even your woodpile, reveals if its winter has ended or not. As darkness fell, honking geese startled me, flying low above the trees like weary travelers arriving late from southern lakes, finally voicing unchecked grievances and shared comfort. At my doorstep, I heard the whoosh of their wings; spotting my light, they abruptly hushed, circled, and landed on the pond. So I went inside, closed the door, and had my first spring night in the forest.</p>

So our prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be blessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of every accident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the influence of the slightest dew that falls on it; and did not spend our time in atoning for the neglect of past opportunities, which we call doing our duty. We loiter in winter while it is already spring. In a pleasant spring morning all men’s sins are forgiven. Such a day is a truce to vice. While such a sun holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may return. Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbors. You may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief, a drunkard, or a sensualist, and merely pitied or despised him, and despaired of the world; but the sun shines bright and warm this first spring morning, re-creating the world, and you meet him at some serene work, and see how his exhausted and debauched veins expand with still joy and bless the new day, feel the spring influence with the innocence of infancy, and all his faults are forgotten. There is not only an atmosphere of good will about him, but even a savor of holiness groping for expression, blindly and ineffectually perhaps, like a new-born instinct, and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgar jest. You see some innocent fair shoots preparing to burst from his gnarled rind and try another year’s life, tender and fresh as the youngest plant. Even he has entered into the joy of his Lord. Why the jailer does not leave open his prison doors,—why the judge does not dismis his case,—why the preacher does not dismiss his congregation! It is because they do not obey the hint which God gives them, nor accept the pardon which he freely offers to all.</p>

We waste time making up for missed chances in the past, which we consider our duty. We idle in winter when spring has already arrived. On a nice spring morning, everyone's mistakes are pardoned. Such a day is a break from wrongdoing. As long as the sun shines, even the worst sinner can change their ways. Through our own restored innocence, we see the innocence in others. Yesterday, you may have known your neighbor to be a criminal, an alcoholic, or a hedonist, and simply felt pity or scorn for them and lost hope in the world. But on this warm, bright first spring morning that renews the world, you see them doing calm work, and notice how their tired and corrupted spirit fills with quiet happiness and appreciates the new day, feeling the spring influence with childlike innocence, and all their wrongdoings are forgotten. They exude not just goodwill, but even a sense of purity trying to express itself, perhaps clumsily and unsuccessfully, like a newborn instinct. And for a brief time, the south hillside echoes no crude jokes. You see some pure, beautiful growth getting ready to emerge from their rough exterior and attempt another year of life, as delicate and new as the youngest seedling. Even they have felt the happiness of their Lord. One wonders why the jailer doesn't open the prison doors, why the judge doesn't throw out the case, and why the preacher doesn't send the congregation home! It's because they don't follow God's prompting or accept the forgiveness he willingly grants to everyone.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0042">On the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank of the river near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the quaking grass and willow roots, where the muskrats lurk, I heard a singular rattling sound, somewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers, when, looking up, I observed a very slight and graceful hawk, like a night-hawk, alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or two over and over, showing the underside of its wings, which gleamed like a satin ribbon in the sun, or like the pearly inside of a shell. This sight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are associated with that sport. The Merlin it seemed to me it might be called: but I care not for its name. It was the most ethereal flight I had ever witnessed. It did not simply flutter like a butterfly, nor soar like the larger hawks, but it sported with proud reliance in the fields of air; mounting again and again with its strange chuckle, it repeated its free and beautiful fall, turning over and over like a kite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as if it had never set its foot on <i>terra firma</i>. It appeared to have no companion in the universe,—sporting there alone,—and to need none but the morning and the ether with which it played. It was not lonely, but made all the earth lonely beneath it. Where was the parent which hatched it, its kindred, and its father in the heavens? The tenant of the air, it seemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in the crevice of a crag;—or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud, woven of the rainbow’s trimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with some soft midsummer haze caught up from earth? Its eyry now some cliffy cloud.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0042">On April 29th, while fishing from the riverbank near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the shaking grass and willow roots where muskrats hide, I heard a unique rattling noise, similar to the sound of sticks that boys play with their fingers. Looking up, I saw a very delicate and graceful hawk, resembling a nighthawk, alternately gliding like a ripple and flipping over and over, revealing the underside of its wings, which shone like a satin ribbon in the sunlight or the pearly inside of a shell. This scene brought to mind falconry and the nobility and poetry associated with that sport. I thought it might be called a Merlin, but I don't care about its name. It was the most otherworldly flight I had ever seen. It didn't just flutter like a butterfly or soar like bigger hawks; it played with confident reliance in the sky, rising again and again with its odd chuckle, repeating its unrestrained and elegant fall, spinning over and over like a kite, then recovering from its high tumbling as if it had never touched the ground. It seemed to have no companion in the universe, playing there alone, needing nothing but the morning and the air with which it frolicked. It wasn't lonely, but made all the earth lonely below it. Where was the parent that hatched it, its family, and its father in the sky? A resident of the air, it appeared connected to the earth only by an egg hatched sometime in the crack of a cliff, or was its native nest made in the corner of a cloud, woven from the trimmings of a rainbow and the sunset sky, and lined with some soft midsummer haze gathered from the earth? Its nest now some rocky cloud.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0043">Beside this I got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous fishes, which looked like a string of jewels. Ah! I have penetrated to those meadows on the morning of many a first spring day, jumping from hummock to hummock, from willow root to willow root, when the wild river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves, as some suppose. There needs no stronger proof of immortality. All things must live in such a light. O Death, where was thy sting? O Grave, where was thy victory, then?</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0043">Along with this, I collected a unique assortment of gold, silver, and shiny copper-colored fish that resembled a strand of gems. Oh, how I've ventured into those fields on countless early spring mornings, leaping from mound to mound and willow root to root, when the untamed river valley and forests were immersed in a light so clear and radiant it could have roused the deceased from their eternal rest, as some believe. There could be no greater evidence of everlasting life. All things must thrive in such illumination. Oh Death, where was your power to harm? Oh Grave, where was your triumph in that moment?</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0044">Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness,—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature. We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and Titanic features, the sea-coast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the thunder cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander. We are cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast. There was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house, which compelled me sometimes to go out of my way, especially in the night when the air was heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another; that tender organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like pulp,—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over in the road; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the liability to accident, we must see how little account is to be made of it. The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence. Poison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds fatal. Compassion is a very untenable ground. It must be expeditious. Its pleadings will not bear to be stereotyped.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0044">Our village life would become stagnant without the unexplored forests and fields that surround it. We need the refreshment of the wild - to sometimes wade in swamps where the heron and the marsh hen hide, and hear the call of the snipe; to smell the rustling reeds where only wilder and more isolated birds build nests, and the mink slinks low to the ground. While we are eager to discover and understand everything, we also need all things to remain mysterious and unexplorable. The land and sea should be endlessly wild, unmapped and unsounded by us because they are unfathomable. We can never get enough of Nature. We must be renewed by the sight of boundless energy, immense and titanic features - the seashore with its shipwrecks, the wild with its living and decaying trees, the thundercloud, and the rain that lasts for weeks and causes floods. We need to see our own boundaries crossed, and life grazing freely in places we never roam. It cheers us to watch the vulture eating the rotting flesh that sickens and saddens us, deriving health and vitality from the meal. There was a dead horse in the valley near the path to my home, which sometimes forced me to go around it, especially at night when the air was thick. But it reassured me of Nature's powerful hunger and indestructible health, which compensated me for the inconvenience. I love seeing how Nature teems with so much life that countless creatures can be sacrificed and allowed to feed on each other; that fragile beings can be so calmly snuffed out of existence like pulp - tadpoles gulped down by herons, turtles and toads run over on the road, and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the ever-present chance of accidents, we must recognize how little it matters in the end. The impression left on a wise person is one of universal innocence. Poison is not truly poisonous, and no wounds are fatal. Compassion is an unsustainable position. It must be swift. Its arguments will not hold up under scrutiny.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0045">Early in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, and other trees, just putting out amidst the pine woods around the pond, imparted a brightness like sunshine to the landscape, especially in cloudy days, as if the sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on the hill-sides here and there. On the third or fourth of May I saw a loon in the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the whippoorwill, the brown-thrasher, the veery, the wood-pewee, the chewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood-thrush long before. The phœbe had already come once more and looked in at my door and window, to see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself on humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while she surveyed the premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch-pine soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore, so that you could have collected a barrel-ful. This is the “sulphur showers  we hear of. Even in Calidas’ drama of Sacontala, we read of “rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus.  And so the seasons went rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and higher grass.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0045">In early May, the oaks, maples, hickories, and other trees just sprouting up in the pine forest around the pond brought a sunny glow to the landscape, especially on overcast days. It was as if the sun was peeking through the mist and lighting up the hillsides here and there. During the first week of May, I spotted a loon on the pond and heard the calls of the whippoorwill, brown thrasher, veery, wood pewee, chewink, and other birds. The wood thrush had already made its presence known well before. The phoebe had also returned, peering into my door and window to see if my house was cave-like enough for her liking. She hovered on fluttering wings with clenched claws, seemingly suspended in the air as she checked out the property. Soon, the sulfur-yellow pollen from the pitch pines blanketed the pond, the rocks, and the decaying wood along the shore. You could have easily gathered up a whole barrel of it. This is what's known as "sulfur showers". Even in Kalidasa's ancient Sanskrit play Shakuntala, there is mention of "streams tinted yellow with the golden dust of the lotus." And so the seasons rolled on towards summer, like someone wandering into taller and taller grass.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0046">Thus was my first year’s life in the woods completed; and the second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0046">So ended my first year living in the forest, and the following year was much the same. I ultimately departed Walden on September 6, 1847.</p>
