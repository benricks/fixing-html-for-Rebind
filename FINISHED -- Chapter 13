There too I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries, small waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be <i>jammed</i>, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the torn and drooping plant. The barberry’s brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln,—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burrs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burrs before they fell. I relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts, as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread. Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fish-worms, I discovered the ground-nut (<i>Apios tuberosa</i>) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not dreamed it. I had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same. Cultivation has well nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish taste, much like that of a frostbitten potato, and I found it better boiled than roasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period. In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root, which was once the <i>totem</i> of an Indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the Indian’s God in the south-west, whence he is said to have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences here, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of art. </p>
      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-i transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0001">In October, I went grape-picking in the river meadows and filled my basket with clusters more valued for their beauty and fragrance than as sustenance. I also admired, though didn't pick, the cranberries—small, waxy, red and pearly gems hanging from the meadow grass. The farmer carelessly harvests them with an ugly rake, leaving the once-smooth meadow in tangles. He measures them only by volume and monetary value before selling them to Boston and New York to get it made into jam, satisfying the tastes of urban nature-lovers. It's like how butchers tear out bison tongues from the prairie grass with no regard for the damaged plants. The barberry's bright fruit was also just eye candy for me, but I gathered some wild apples for cooking that others had missed. When chestnuts were ripe, I stored half a bushel for winter. Roaming the vast chestnut woods of Lincoln in those days—which now lie dormant under the railroad—was thrilling, with a collection bag over my shoulder and a stick for opening burrs, not always waiting for the frost. The rustling leaves and scolding of red squirrels and jays, whose half-eaten nuts I sometimes took, kept me company. The burrs they had selected always contained good nuts. I occasionally climbed up to shake the trees too. Some chestnut trees also grew behind my house, including a large one that nearly overshadowed it. When in bloom, it was a fragrant bouquet for the whole area, but squirrels and jays got most of its nuts, with the jays coming in early morning flocks to pick them out before they dropped. I left those trees to them and went to the farther-off woods made up entirely of chestnut. As far as they went, these nuts were a decent bread substitute. Many other replacements could likely be found too. One day, while digging for fishing worms, I found ground-nuts (Apios tuberosa) on their strings—the potatoes of the native people. It was like a mythical fruit that I had started to question if I had actually dug up and eaten in my youth as I'd claimed, or just dreamt it. I had often seen its crinkled red velvety flowers supported by other plant stems since then, without realizing it was the same thing. Farming has nearly wiped it out. Boiled, it tasted better than roasted, with a sweetness similar to a frost-bitten potato. This tuber seemed to be nature's faint promise to someday raise and simply feed her own children here again. In these times of fattened cattle and waving grain fields, this modest root, once the symbol of a Native American tribe, is nearly forgotten or only known by its flowered vines. But if wild nature reigned here again, the delicate, indulgent English grains would likely vanish before countless enemies. And without human help, crows may even carry the last corn seeds back to the great maize field of the Native American god in the southwest, where it's said to have come from originally. Yet the now nearly extinct ground-nut might thrive once more in spite of the cold and untamed land, proving itself native, and regain its former significance and stature as food for the hunting tribes. Some Native American Ceres or Minerva must have created and given this gift, and when the poetic era begins here, its leaves and nut clusters may appear in our artwork.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water. Ah, many a tale their color told! And gradually from week to week the character of each tree came out, and it admired itself reflected in the smooth mirror of the lake. Each morning the manager of this gallery substituted some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring, for the old upon the walls.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">By September 1st, I had already spotted a few small maples that had turned bright red across the pond. They were located below the point where three white aspen trunks split off, right next to the water. Oh, their colors told quite a story! Week by week, the unique character of each tree emerged, and it seemed to admire its own reflection in the calm, mirror-like lake. Each morning, the manager of this natural gallery would swap out the old pictures on the walls, replacing them with new ones featuring more vivid and harmonious colors.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">The wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter quarters, and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-head, sometimes deterring visitors from entering. Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I swept some of them out, but I did not trouble myself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter. They never molested me seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">Thousands of wasps came to my cabin in October, looking for a place to spend the winter. They gathered on my windows and walls, sometimes scaring off visitors. Each morning when the cold made them sluggish, I brushed some of them outside. But I didn't put much effort into getting rid of them all. I actually felt flattered that they saw my home as a cozy shelter. They never bothered me too much, even though they slept in my space. Gradually, they vanished into unknown cracks and crevices, escaping the winter and its awful chill.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Like the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November, I used to resort to the north-east side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the fire-side of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire. I thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a departed hunter, had left.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">Like the wasps, before I finally went into my winter home in November, I would go to the northeast side of Walden Pond, where the sun reflected off the pine woods and rocky shore, making it the warm side of the pond. It's so much nicer and healthier to be warmed by the sun while you can, rather than by a man-made fire. In this way, I warmed myself by the still glowing coals that summer had left behind, like a hunter who had gone away.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">When I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks being second-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels. The mortar on them was fifty years old, and was said to be still growing harder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably harder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many fire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled the spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place. I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of the house. Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at the ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put to it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me the labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was calculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an independent structure, standing on the ground and rising through the house to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent. This was toward the end of summer. It was now November.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">When I decided to build my chimney, I took the time to learn about masonry. Since my bricks were used, I had to clean them with a trowel. This taught me a great deal about the properties of bricks and trowels. The mortar on the bricks was 50 years old, and people said it was still getting harder, but this is one of those things that gets repeated without knowing if it's true. These sayings themselves become more firmly held over time, and it would take a lot of effort to convince someone otherwise. Many villages in Mesopotamia are constructed with high-quality second-hand bricks from the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is even older and likely harder. In any case, I was impressed by how tough the steel was, withstanding so many hard blows without wearing out. Since my bricks had previously been in a chimney, I selected as many fireplace bricks as I could to save effort and minimize waste, even though they didn't have Nebuchadnezzar's name on them. I filled the gaps between the bricks around the fireplace with rocks from the pond shore and made my mortar using white sand from the same location. I spent the most time on the fireplace since it's the most important part of the house. In fact, I worked so slowly that even though I started in the morning, a row of bricks just above the floor was my pillow at night, yet I don't recall getting a stiff neck from it; my stiff neck is from an older time. Around then, I had a poet stay with me for two weeks, which made the space tight. He brought his own knife, although I had two, and we would clean them by sticking them in the ground. He helped me with the cooking. I was happy to see my work progressively rising so square and solid, and I thought that even if it was slow, it was made to last a long time. The chimney is a somewhat separate structure, standing on its own from the ground up through the house to the sky. Even if the house burns down, the chimney sometimes remains standing, showing its significance and independence. This was near the end of summer. It was now November.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">The north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity over-head, where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family (<i>patremfamilias</i>) must have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriæ erit,  that is, “an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory.  I had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a peck each. </p>

My house never looked as good to me after it was plastered, though I had to admit it was more comfortable. Shouldn't every room where a person lives be high enough to create some darkness overhead, where flickering shadows can dance about the rafters in the evening? These shapes are more pleasing to the imagination than fresco paintings or the most costly furniture. I only really started living in my house, I might say, when I began using it for warmth as well as shelter. I had gotten a couple of old andirons to keep the wood from the hearth, and it made me happy to see the soot form on the back of the chimney that I had built, and I poked the fire with more satisfaction than usual. My home was small, and I could barely hear an echo in it, but it felt bigger for being a single room and far from neighbors. All the appeals of a house were focused in one space; it was the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and family room; and whatever contentment a parent or child, master or servant, gets from living in a house, I enjoyed it all.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">I sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a golden age, of enduring materials, and without ginger-bread work, which shall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial, primitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one’s head,—useful to keep off rain and snow; where the king and queen posts stand out to receive your homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate Saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill; a cavernous house, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof; where some may live in the fire-place, some in the recess of a window, and some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and some aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which you have got into when you have opened the outside door, and the ceremony is over; where the weary traveller may wash, and eat, and converse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the essentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see all the treasures of the house at one view, and every thing hangs upon its peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor, chamber, store-house, and garret; where you can see so necessary a thing as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and hear the pot boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner and the oven that bakes your bread, and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments; where the washing is not put out, nor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes requested to move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the cellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping. A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a bird’s nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully excluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and told to make yourself at home there,—in solitary confinement. Nowadays the host does not admit you to <i>his</i> hearth, but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in his alley, and hospitality is the art of <i>keeping</i> you at the greatest distance. There is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you. I am aware that I have been on many a man’s premises, and might have been legally ordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men’s houses. I might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as I have described, if I were going their way; but backing out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to learn, if ever I am caught in one.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">I sometimes dream of a larger, more crowded house from a golden age, built with lasting materials and no frills. It would have just one huge, simple room—a spacious, rustic hall with exposed rafters and beams holding up a kind of lower sky above, useful for keeping out rain and snow. The main posts stand out to receive your respect, after you bow to the fallen Saturn of an older time when crossing the threshold. It's a cave-like house, where you need a torch on a pole to see the ceiling. Some may stay by the fireplace, some by a window, some on benches, some at one end of the hall or the other, and some up in the rafters with the spiders if they like. Once inside the outer door, the formalities are done. The tired traveler can wash, eat, talk, and sleep, and wouldn’t need to go any further. It's a refuge you'd be glad to find on a stormy night, with all a house needs and nothing extra for housekeeping. You can see all the house's treasures at a glance, everything hanging on its peg that a person would use. It's kitchen, pantry, living room, bedroom, storage, and attic all at once. You see essentials like a barrel or ladder and useful things like a cupboard, hear the pot boil, and greet the fire that cooks your food and the oven that bakes your bread. The needed furniture and tools are the main decor. Laundry, fire, and the lady of the house aren't hidden away. You might be asked to move off the trapdoor so the cook can go to the cellar, learning if the ground below is solid or hollow without stomping. The inside is as open and clear as a bird's nest. You can't enter the front and leave the back without seeing some occupants. Being a guest means having the run of the house and not being shut away in a room and told to make yourself at home there in isolation. These days, the host doesn't welcome you to his hearth, but has the mason build you one somewhere in his alley. Hospitality now means keeping you at a distance. There's as much secrecy about the cooking as if he meant to poison you. I know I've been on many a man's property and could have been legally told to leave, but I don't think I've been in many actual homes. I might visit, in my old clothes, a king and queen living in such a house if I were going their way. But backing out of a modern palace is all I'd care to learn if I'm ever caught in one.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into <i>palaver</i> wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched, through slides and dumb-waiters, as it were; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly. As if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a trope from them. How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North West Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen? </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">It appears that the language used in our living rooms would become completely weak and turn into mere chatter. Our lives are so distant from the symbols, metaphors, and figures of speech used, which are necessarily far-reaching, as if through dumbwaiters and slides. In other words, the living room is quite far from the kitchen and workshop. Even dinner is usually just a representation of a meal. It's as if only someone living close to Nature and Truth can use expressions borrowed from them. How can an academic, residing in a remote place like the Northwest Territories or the Isle of Man, know what's appropriate in the kitchen?</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">However, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a hasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its foundations. Nevertheless, it stood through a great many hasty-puddings.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">However, only a couple of my visitors ever had the courage to remain and share a quick meal with me. But when they saw that critical moment coming, they made a fast exit, as if it would rattle the house to its core. Still, the house endured through many rushed dinners.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">I did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat, a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary. My house had in the mean while been shingled down to the ground on every side. In lathing I was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine clothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to workmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up his cuffs, seized a plasterer’s board, and having loaded his trowel without mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead, made a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete discomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom. I admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the <i>Unio fluviatilis</i>, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment; so that I knew where my materials came from. I might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to do so.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">I waited until the weather was freezing to plaster. I brought over whiter, cleaner sand for this job from the other side of the pond by boat, which I would have used to go much further if needed. Meanwhile, my house had been shingled on all sides down to the ground. When lathing, I was happy to drive each nail home with just one hammer blow. My goal was to move the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and quickly. I recalled the tale of an arrogant man who used to hang around the village in fancy clothes, giving workers advice. One day, he decided to take action instead of just talking. He rolled up his sleeves, grabbed a plasterer's board, and loaded his trowel without any mishap. With a self-satisfied look at the lathing above, he made a bold motion towards it. Immediately, to his utter embarrassment, he got the entire contents all over his frilly shirt. I gained new respect for the efficiency and practicality of plastering, which seals out the cold so well and provides an attractive finish. I also learned about the different injuries that can happen to someone working with plaster. I was amazed at how thirsty the bricks were, soaking up all the moisture from my plaster before I could smooth it, and how many buckets of water it takes to prepare a new hearth. The previous winter, I had made a small amount of lime by burning shells from the mussels (<i class="calibre3">Unio fluviatilis</i>) found in our river, just to try it. So I knew the source of my materials. I could have obtained good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself if I had wanted to.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">The pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing. The first ice is especially interesting and perfect, being hard, dark, and transparent, and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow; for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick, like a skater insect on the surface of the water, and study the bottom at your leisure, only two or three inches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and the water is necessarily always smooth then. There are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute grains of white quartz. Perhaps these have creased it, for you find some of their cases in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for them to make. But the ice itself is the object of most interest, though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it. If you examine it closely the morning after it freezes, you find that the greater part of the bubbles, which at first appeared to be within it, are against its under surface, and that more are continually rising from the bottom; while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark, that is, you see the water through it. These bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see your face reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch. There are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp cones with the apex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh, minute spherical bubbles one directly above another, like a string of beads. But these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath. I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them, which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day when I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that those large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had formed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake. But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity; they were no longer one directly over another, but often like silvery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as if occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the ice was gone, and it was too late to study the bottom. Being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out a cake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward. The new ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included between the two ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against the upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and I was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of an inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles, which were a foot in diameter. I inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise, and that each, in its degree, had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it. These are the little air-guns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">The pond had already frozen over in the shadiest and shallowest areas, sometimes days or even weeks before the rest of it froze. The first ice is especially fascinating and flawless, being firm, dark, and clear. It provides the best chance to examine the shallow bottom of the pond. You can lay on inch-thick ice, like an insect skating on the water's surface, and leisurely study the bottom just a few inches away, as if looking at a picture through glass. The water is always smooth then. Many furrows in the sand show where creatures have traveled and doubled back. The pond floor is littered with cases of caddisfly larvae made from tiny white quartz grains. Perhaps these have etched the furrows, though they seem too deep and wide for such small creatures. But the ice itself is the most interesting thing to observe, and you must take advantage of the first opportunity to study it. If you look at it closely the morning after it freezes, you'll see that most of the bubbles that initially seemed to be inside the ice are actually against its underside, with more continually rising from the bottom. At this point, the ice is still relatively solid and dark, allowing you to see the water through it. These bubbles range from one-eightieth to one-eighth of an inch wide, very clear and beautiful, and they reflect your face when you look through the ice. There can be thirty or forty bubbles per square inch. Within the ice, there are also narrow, oblong, vertical bubbles about half an inch long that look like sharp cones pointing upward. If the ice is very fresh, there will be tiny spherical bubbles stacked like beads on a string. However, these bubbles within the ice are less numerous and noticeable than those underneath. I sometimes threw stones to test the ice's strength, and the ones that broke through carried air with them, forming large, prominent white bubbles below. When I returned to the same spot two days later, I saw that those big bubbles were still intact, even though another inch of ice had formed, which I could tell from the seam at the edge of an ice sheet. But since the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the ice was no longer clear. Instead of the dark green color of the water and the bottom, it was opaque and whitish or gray. Despite being twice as thick, it was barely stronger than before because the air bubbles had expanded significantly in the heat and merged together, losing their uniform arrangement. They were no longer stacked neatly but often overlapped like silver coins poured from a bag or in thin flakes as if filling slight cracks. The ice had lost its beauty, and it was too late to examine the bottom. Curious about the position of my large bubbles in the new ice, I broke out a piece containing a medium-sized bubble and flipped it upside down. The new ice had formed around and under the bubble, trapping it between the two layers. It was entirely in the lower ice but pressed close against the upper layer. The bubble was slightly flattish, perhaps lenticular, with a rounded edge, a quarter-inch deep and four inches across. I was amazed to discover that directly beneath the bubble, the ice had melted with great uniformity into the shape of an inverted saucer, reaching a depth of five-eighths of an inch in the center. This left a thin divider between the water and the bubble, barely an eighth of an inch thick. In many places, the tiny bubbles in this divider had burst downward, and there was likely no ice at all under the biggest bubbles, which were a foot wide. I concluded that the countless microscopic bubbles I had initially observed against the underside of the ice were now also frozen in place. Each one, to some degree, had acted like a magnifying glass on the ice below, melting and eroding it. These are the little air guns that help make the ice crack and whoop.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0012">At length the winter set in in good earnest, just as I had finished plastering, and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then. Night after night the geese came lumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even after the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and some flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico. Several times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o’clock at night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they had come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of December, Flint’s and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more; in ’46, the 16th; in ’49, about the 31st; and in ’50, about the 27th of December; in ’52, the 5th of January; in ’53, the 31st of December. The snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my shell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How much more interesting an event is that man’s supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the growth of the young wood. There was also the drift-wood of the pond. In the course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logs with the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was built. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though waterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the ice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them across. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they not only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that they burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by the water, burned longer, as in a lamp.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0012">The winter finally arrived in full force, just as I finished plastering. The wind howled around the house as if it had been waiting for permission. Night after night, geese flew in noisily in the dark, even after snow covered the ground. Some landed in Walden, while others flew low over the woods toward Fair Haven, heading for Mexico. Several times, when returning from the village late at night, I heard a flock of geese or ducks walking on the dry leaves in the woods by a pond behind my house. They had come to feed, and I heard the faint call of their leader as they hurried away. Walden froze completely for the first time in 1845 on December 22. Shallower ponds and the river had already been frozen for over a week. In the following years, it froze around mid to late December. Snow had already blanketed the ground since November 25, suddenly surrounding me with a winter landscape. I retreated further into my home and tried to keep a warm fire burning both in my house and in my heart. My outdoor work now involved collecting dead wood in the forest, carrying it by hand or over my shoulders, and sometimes dragging a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old, worn-out forest fence was a great find for me. I sacrificed it to Vulcan, as it could no longer serve Terminus. A man's meal is much more interesting when he has just been out in the snow to hunt, or even to steal the fuel to cook it with! His bread and meat taste better. There is enough scrap wood in most of our town forests to support many fires, but currently, it warms no one and some believe it hinders new growth. There was also driftwood from the pond. In the summer, I had found a raft of pitch-pine logs still covered in bark, fastened together by the Irish during the railroad construction. I pulled it partly onto the shore. After soaking for two years and then sitting out for six months, it was completely sound, though too waterlogged to dry. One winter day, I amused myself by sliding the logs piecemeal nearly half a mile across the pond. I skated behind with one end of a 15-foot log on my shoulder and the other on the ice. I also lashed a few logs together using a flexible birch branch and pulled them across using a longer birch or alder stick with a hook on one end. Despite being waterlogged and heavy as lead, they not only burned for a long time but also made a very hot fire. In fact, I thought they burned better after soaking, as if the pitch, trapped by the water, burned longer like in a lamp.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0013">Gilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that “the encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest,  were “considered as great nuisances by the old forest law, and were severely punished under the name of <i>purprestures</i>, as tending <i>ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentum forestæ</i>, &amp;c.,  to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the forest. But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had been the Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I burned it myself by accident, I grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors; nay, I grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves. I would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old Romans did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a consecrated grove (<i>lucum conlucare</i>), that is, would believe that it is sacred to some god. The Roman made an expiatory offering, and prayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred, be propitious to me, my family, and children, &amp;c. </p>

But I cared more about preserving the deer and the greenery than the hunters or woodcutters did, as much as if I had been the Lord Warden himself. If any part was burned, even if I accidentally burned it myself, I mourned with a sorrow that outlasted and was more inconsolable than that of the owners. In fact, I grieved when the owners themselves cut it down. I wish that our farmers, when they cut down a forest, felt some of the reverence that the ancient Romans did when they thinned or let light into a sacred grove (<i class="calibre3">L</i>ucum conlucare). In other words, I wish they would believe that the forest is holy to some god.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0014">It is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this new country, a value more permanent and universal than that of gold. After all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood. It is as precious to us as it was to our Saxon and Norman ancestors. If they made their bows of it, we make our gun-stocks of it. Michaux, more than thirty years ago, says that the price of wood for fuel in New York and Philadelphia “nearly equals, and sometimes exceeds, that of the best wood in Paris, though this immense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords, and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated plains.  In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the only question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last. Mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand, are sure to attend the wood auction, and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper. It is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts; the New Englander and the New Hollander, the Parisian and the Celt, the farmer and Robinhood, Goody Blake and Harry Gill, in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant, the scholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food. Neither could I do without them.</p>

Over thirty years ago, Michaux noted that the price of firewood in New York and Philadelphia nearly matched, and sometimes surpassed, that of the best wood in Paris, despite the immense capital requiring over 300,000 cords annually and being surrounded by 300 miles of cultivated land. In this town, the price of wood climbs almost constantly, with the only question being how much higher it will be this year compared to last.

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0015">Every man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection. I love to have mine before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work. I had an old axe which nobody claimed, with which by spells in winter days, on the sunny side of the house, I played about the stumps which I had got out of my bean-field. As my driver prophesied when I was ploughing, they warmed me twice, once while I was splitting them, and again when they were on the fire, so that no fuel could give out more heat. As for the axe, I was advised to get the village blacksmith to “jump  it; but I jumped him, and, putting a hickory helve from the woods into it, made it do. If it was dull, it was at least hung true.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0016">A few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure. It is interesting to remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth. In previous years I had often gone “prospecting  over some bare hill-side, where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stood, and got out the fat pine roots. They are almost indestructible. Stumps thirty or forty years old, at least, will still be sound at the core, though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould, as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart. With axe and shovel you explore this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef tallow, or as if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth. But commonly I kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had stored up in my shed before the snow came. Green hickory finely split makes the woodchopper’s kindlings, when he has a camp in the woods. Once in a while I got a little of this. When the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of Walden vale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney, that I was awake.—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0016">Discovering a few pieces of fat pine was a real treasure. It's fascinating to think about how much of this fire-starting material still lies hidden deep underground. In the past, I often went "prospecting" on barren hillsides where pitch-pine woods once stood, digging up the resinous roots. They're nearly indestructible. Even after thirty or forty years, the core of old stumps remains solid, although the sapwood has turned to vegetable mold, as shown by the thick bark scales forming a ring several inches from the center. With an ax and shovel, you can mine this resource, following the marrow-like store, yellow as beef tallow or as if you've struck gold, deep into the earth. But usually, I lit my fire with dry forest leaves, which I had collected in my shed before the snow fell. Finely split green hickory makes the best kindling for a woodchopper camping in the forest. Occasionally I obtained some of this. When folks in the village lit their fires beyond the horizon, I also alerted the various wild residents of Walden Vale of my wakefulness, with a smoky streamer from my chimney.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0027">Hard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, anwered my purpose better than any other. I sometimes left a good fire when I went to take a walk in a winter afternoon; and when I returned, three or four hours afterward, it would be still alive and glowing. My house was not empty though I was gone. It was as if I had left a cheerful housekeeper behind. It was I and Fire that lived there; and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy. One day, however, as I was splitting wood, I thought that I would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire; it was the only time I remember to have been particularly anxious on this score; so I looked and saw that a spark had caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as my hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0027">I preferred using hard green wood that was freshly cut, though I didn't need much of it. It served my needs better than any other type. Sometimes I would leave a nice fire burning when I went for a walk on a winter afternoon. When I came back three or four hours later, it would still be alive and glowing. Even though I was gone, my house wasn't empty. It felt like I had left a pleasant housekeeper behind. The house was occupied by me and fire, and usually my housekeeper was reliable. However, one day while I was chopping wood, I thought I should peek in the window to make sure the house wasn't burning down. It was the only time I recall being especially worried about that. When I looked, I noticed a spark had landed on my bed. I went inside and put it out after it had burned an area the size of my hand. But my house was positioned in such a sunny, protected spot with a low roof that I could let the fire die out in the middle of nearly any winter day.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0028">The moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper; for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man, and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to secure them. Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself. The animal merely makes a bed, which he warms with his body, in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered fire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and warms that, instead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and with a lamp lengthen out the day. Thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct, and saves a little time for the fine arts. Though, when I had been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time, my whole body began to grow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of my house I soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life. But the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect, nor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed. It would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north. We go on dating from Cold Fridays and Great Snows; but a little colder Friday, or greater snow, would put a period to man’s existence on the globe.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0028">The moles made their home in my basement, eating every third potato and creating a cozy bed using hair from plastering and brown paper. Even wild animals love comfort and warmth like humans do, surviving winter by carefully securing them. Some friends acted as if I came to the woods just to freeze. Animals simply make a bed to warm with their body in a sheltered spot. But humans, having discovered fire, trap air in a large room and heat that instead. This allows them to remove bulky clothing, enjoy summer conditions in winter, and use windows to let in light, extending the day with lamps. This goes beyond instinct, saving time for the arts. Though after facing harsh winds, my body grew numb, I quickly recovered upon reaching my warm house. Even the wealthiest people can't brag much about their ability to withstand extreme conditions. We don't need to worry about how humanity might eventually die out. A slightly harsher cold snap from the north could easily wipe us out. We talk about infamous cold days and big snowstorms, but an even colder day or a bigger blizzard could spell the end for humans on Earth.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0029">The next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did not own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open fire-place. Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic, but merely a chemic process. It will soon be forgotten, in these days of stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the Indian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house, but it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You can always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at evening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look into the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force.—

      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0029">The following winter, I used a small stove to save money since I didn't own the forest, but it didn't maintain a fire as well as an open fireplace. Cooking became more of a chemical process than a poetic one. In this age of stoves, people will soon forget that we once roasted potatoes in the ashes like the Indians did. The stove took up space, made the house smell, and hid the fire, making me feel like I had lost a friend. You can always see a face in the flames. In the evening, a worker gazing into the fire would cleanse their thoughts of the day's impurities and worldliness. But I could no longer sit and stare into the fire, and a poet's relevant words came back to me with renewed impact.</p>
