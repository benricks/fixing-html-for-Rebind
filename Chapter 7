What was the meaning of this so steady and self-respecting, this small Herculean labor, I knew not. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antæus. But why should I raise them? Only Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all summer,—to make this portion of the earth’s surface, which had yielded only cinquefoil, blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet wild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse. What shall I learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them, early and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It is a fine broad leaf to look on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains which water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself, which for the most part is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, cool days, and most of all woodchucks. The last have nibbled for me a quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust johnswort and the rest, and break up their ancient herb garden? Soon, however, the remaining beans will be too tough for them, and go forward to meet new foes.</p>

The earliest had grown significantly before the latest were planted, and they wouldn't be easily delayed. I didn't understand the purpose of this steady and dignified small Herculean effort. I grew to love my rows and beans, though I had far more than I needed. They connected me to the earth, giving me strength like Antaeus. But why should I grow them? Only Heaven knows. All summer, my curious task was to make this patch of earth, which had previously only yielded wildflowers and berries, produce this crop instead. What will I learn from beans, or they from me? I nurture them, hoe them early and late, and keep a close eye on them; this is my daily work. The broad leaves are beautiful to behold. My helpers are the dews and rains that water this dry ground, and whatever fertility remains in the mostly barren soil. My foes are worms, cool days, and especially woodchucks, which have nibbled a quarter-acre clean. But what right did I have to displace the wildflowers and disrupt their ancient garden? Soon, though, the remaining beans will be too tough for them, and will face new enemies.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0002">When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture, and even I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0002">I vividly recall being taken from Boston to my hometown through these same woods and field to the pond when I was just four years old. It's one of my earliest memories. Tonight, my flute's music echoed over that very same water. The pines here are even older than me. If some have fallen, I've used their stumps to cook my dinner. New trees are growing all around, creating a fresh view for young eyes. Nearly the same flowers grow from the same roots in this field. I've even helped shape the mythical landscape from my childhood dreams. My presence and impact can be seen in these bean leaves, corn stalks, and potato plants.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0003">I planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only about fifteen years since the land was cleared, and I myself had got out two or three cords of stumps, I did not give it any manure; but in the course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which I turned up in hoeing, that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land, and so, to some extent, had exhausted the soil for this very crop.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0003">I planted around two and a half acres of upland. Since the land had only been cleared about fifteen years ago, and I had removed two or three cords of stumps myself, I didn't fertilize it. But over the summer, the arrowheads I uncovered while hoeing showed that an ancient nation had lived here and grew corn and beans before Europeans arrived to clear the land, somewhat depleting the soil for these very crops.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0004">Before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the sun had got above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the farmers warned me against it,—I would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on,—I began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet. There the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout. Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grass,—this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than usual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic result. A very <i>agricola laboriosus</i> was I to travellers bound westward through Lincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at their ease in gigs, with elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in festoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only open and cultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road; so they made the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers’ gossip and comment than was meant for his ear: “Beans so late! peas so late! —for I continued to plant when others had begun to hoe,—the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it. “Corn, my boy, for fodder; corn for fodder.  “Does he <i>live</i> there?  asks the black bonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste stuff, or it may be ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a half of furrows, and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw it,—there being an aversion to other carts and horses,—and chip dirt far away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with the fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in the agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman’s report. And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of <i>English</i> hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond holes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as some states are civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my hoe played the <i>Ranz des Vaches</i> for them.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0004">Before any woodchuck or squirrel had crossed the road, or the sun had risen above the shrub oaks, while the dew was still fresh, I began to level the ranks of proud weeds in my bean-field and throw dust on their heads. The farmers warned me against it, but I would advise you to do all your work while the dew is on, if possible. Early in the morning I worked barefoot, playing like an artist in the dewy, crumbling sand, but later the sun burned my feet. There the sun lit my way as I hoed beans, pacing slowly back and forth over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows. One end stopped at a shrub oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other at a blackberry field where the berries ripened as I finished each row.

        Pulling the weeds, adding fresh soil around the bean stems, and helping the crop I had planted - making the yellow soil sprout bean leaves and flowers instead of weeds - this was my daily work. I had little help from animals or hired workers or better tools, so I was much slower, and grew closer to my beans than usual. But working with your hands, even when it feels like a chore, is never the worst kind of idleness. It teaches a lasting moral lesson, and gives the thinker a classic result.

        I was a very hard-working farmer to travelers going west to who knows where. They sat at ease in their wagons, elbows on knees and reins hanging loose. I was the one who stayed home, working the land. But soon my farm was out of their sight and mind. It was the only open, planted field for a long way on either side of the road, so they paid it extra attention. Sometimes the man in the field heard more gossip and comments from travelers than he wanted to: "Beans so late! Peas so late!" For I kept planting when others had started hoeing. "Corn for animal feed, my boy, corn for feed."

        "Does he live there?" the lady in the black bonnet asks the man in the gray coat. The tough old farmer reins up his horse to ask what you're doing, seeing no manure in the furrow. He suggests adding some wood chips or ashes or plaster. But here I had two and a half acres of furrows, and only a hoe to plow with and two hands to pull it - I disliked using other carts and horses - and the wood chips were far away. Fellow travelers passing by compared my field out loud to the ones they'd seen, so I learned how I measured up as a farmer. This field wasn't in any agriculture report. And who measures the value of the wild crop nature grows in the untamed fields and forests? They carefully weigh the English hay harvest and measure its minerals, but all through the woods and meadows and marshes, a rich and varied crop grows that no one reaps but nature. My field was like a link between the wild and tamed lands, half-cultivated you could say. I grew beans that gladly returned to their wild roots, and my hoe played their mountain song as I worked.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0005">Near at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the brown-thrasher—or red mavis, as some love to call him—all the morning, glad of your society, that would find out another farmer’s field if yours were not here. While you are planting the seed, he cries,—“Drop it, drop it,—cover it up, cover it up,—pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.  But this was not corn, and so it was safe from such enemies as he. You may wonder what his rigmarole, his amateur Paganini performances on one string or on twenty, have to do with your planting, and yet prefer it to leached ashes or plaster. It was a cheap sort of top dressing in which I had entire faith.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0005">Close by, perched on the highest branch of a birch tree, the brown thrasher - or red mavis, as some fondly refer to him - sings joyfully all morning, delighted by your presence. If your field wasn't here, he would seek out another farmer's land. As you sow the seeds, he calls out, "Drop it, drop it - cover it up, cover it up - pull it up, pull it up, pull it up." But this wasn't corn, so it remained safe from such threats. You might question what his rambling, his novice Paganini-like performances on one string or twenty, have to do with your planting, yet you prefer it over fertilizer or plaster. It was an inexpensive form of fertilizer in which I had complete confidence.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0006">As I drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe, I disturbed the ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens, and their small implements of war and hunting were brought to the light of this modern day. They lay mingled with other natural stones, some of which bore the marks of having been burned by Indian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits of pottery and glass brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil. When my hoe tinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky, and was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and immeasurable crop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed beans; and I remembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at all, my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios. The night-hawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons—for I sometimes made a day of it—like a mote in the eye, or in heaven’s eye, falling from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent, torn at last to very rags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope remained; small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills, where few have found them; graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond, as leaves are raised by the wind to float in the heavens; such kindredship is in Nature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and surveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the elemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair of hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and descending, approaching, and leaving one another, as if they were the embodiment of my own thoughts. Or I was attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to that, with a slight quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste; or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander, a trace of Egypt and the Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused to lean on my hoe, these sounds and sights I heard and saw anywhere in the row, a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0006">As I added fresh soil around the rows with my hoe, I unearthed the remains of ancient, forgotten peoples who once lived under these skies. Their small weapons and hunting tools were brought into the modern day. They were mixed with other rocks, some burned by Indian fires or the sun, along with pieces of pottery and glass left by recent farmers. When my hoe clinked against the stones, the sound echoed through the woods and sky, accompanying my work and yielding an instant, immense harvest. I was no longer simply hoeing beans, and I pitied and took pride in my friends who had gone to the city for concerts. The nighthawk circled overhead on sunny afternoons - for I sometimes spent the whole day - like a speck in the eye of heaven, occasionally swooping down with a sound like the heavens tearing apart, yet leaving a seamless expanse behind. These small creatures fill the air and lay eggs on bare sand or hilltop rocks, graceful and slender like ripples lifted from a pond by the wind to float in the sky, showing the kinship in nature. The hawk is the aerial sibling of the wave it glides over, its perfect wings mirroring the sea's elemental, unfledged pinions. Sometimes I watched a pair of hawks soaring and descending, nearing and parting, as if embodying my own thoughts. Or I was drawn by the passage of wild pigeons from one wood to another, with their soft, winnowing sound and swift flight. My hoe also unearthed a sluggish, ominous, exotic spotted salamander from under a rotten stump, a trace of Egypt and the Nile in our modern time. When I paused to rest on my hoe, these sights and sounds were everywhere in the field, part of the endless entertainment the countryside provides.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0007">On gala days the town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to these woods, and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate thus far. To me, away there in my bean-field at the other end of the town, the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst; and when there was a military turnout of which I was ignorant, I have sometimes had a vague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the horizon, as if some eruption would break out there soon, either scarlatina or canker-rash, until at length some more favorable puff of wind, making haste over the fields and up the Wayland road, brought me information of the “trainers.  It seemed by the distant hum as if somebody’s bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to Virgil’s advice, by a faint <i>tintinnabulum</i> upon the most sonorous of their domestic utensils, were endeavoring to call them down into the hive again. And when the sound died quite away, and the hum had ceased, and the most favorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they had got the last drone of them all safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now their minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0007">On festive days, the town's cannons fire, echoing like toy guns in these forests, and occasional bits of military music reach this far. For me, working in my bean field across town, the cannons sounded like a mushroom had popped. When there was a military event I didn't know about, I sometimes felt an odd, itchy unease on the horizon all day, as if an outbreak of scarlet fever or rash might erupt there. Eventually, a favorable gust of wind hurrying over the fields and up the Wayland road would bring me news of the "trainers." The distant hum sounded like someone's bees had swarmed, and the neighbors, following Virgil's suggestion, were trying to call them back to the hive by softly ringing their most ringing household items. When the sound faded completely and the hum stopped, with even the best winds staying silent, I knew they had safely gotten the last drone into the Middlesex hive, and could now focus on the honey coating it.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0008">I felt proud to know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our fatherland were in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing again I was filled with an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0008">I was proud to know that the freedoms of Massachusetts and America were so well protected. As I returned to my hoeing, I felt an incredible sense of confidence and continued my work happily, with a peaceful faith in what was to come.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0009">When there were several bands of musicians, it sounded as if all the village was a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a din. But sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these woods, and the trumpet that sings of fame, and I felt as if I could spit a Mexican with a good relish,—for why should we always stand for trifles?—and looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon. These martial strains seemed as far away as Palestine, and reminded me of a march of crusaders in the horizon, with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of the elm-tree tops which overhang the village. This was one of the <i>great</i> days; though the sky had from my clearing only the same everlastingly great look that it wears daily, and I saw no difference in it.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0009">When multiple bands played, it felt like the entire village was a giant bellows, with all the buildings swelling and shrinking to the pulsing beat. But at times, a truly majestic and uplifting melody would reach the forest. The trumpets sang of glory, and I felt I could defeat any foe with relish. Why should we always sweat the small stuff? I searched for a critter to test my valor on. Those triumphant tunes seemed as distant as the Holy Land, evoking images of crusaders marching on the horizon. The elm treetops above the village swayed with a soft galloping rhythm. It was one of those momentous days, even though the sky looked the same as always from my vantage point, eternally grand and unchanging.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0010">It was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated with beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and threshing, and picking over and selling them,—the last was the hardest of all,—I might add eating, for I did taste. I was determined to know beans. When they were growing, I used to hoe from five o’clock in the morning till noon, and commonly spent the rest of the day about other affairs. Consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of weeds,—it will bear some iteration in the account, for there was no little iteration in the labor,—disturbing their delicate organizations so ruthlessly, and making such invidious distinctions with his hoe, levelling whole ranks of one species, and sedulously cultivating another. That’s Roman wormwood,—that’s pigweed,—that’s sorrel,—that’s piper-grass,—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fibre in the shade, if you do he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in two days. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest-waving Hector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and rolled in the dust.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0010">Growing beans was a unique experience for me. From planting, hoeing, harvesting, threshing, sorting and selling them - the last part was the toughest. I even tasted them, as I was set on really knowing beans. During the growing season, I would hoe from early morning until noon, then spend the afternoon on other tasks. It's amazing how well you get to know different types of weeds. I had to disrupt their delicate structures so harshly with my hoe, favoring some species while fiercely uprooting others. Roman wormwood, pigweed, sorrel, crabgrass - I chopped them up and turned their roots to the sun, not letting a single fiber stay shaded or they'd bounce right back in a couple days. It was a long battle, not against cranes, but against those weed Trojans that had the weather on their side. Each day the beans watched me come to their aid, hoe in hand, thinning out the enemy ranks and burying the dead weeds in the furrows. Many a proud, towering weed Hector that stood a foot taller than its crowding allies fell to my hoe and bit the dust.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0011">Those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine arts in Boston or Rome, and others to contemplation in India, and others to trade in London or New York, I thus, with the other farmers of New England, devoted to husbandry. Not that I wanted beans to eat, for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned, whether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged them for rice; but, perchance, as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression, to serve a parable-maker one day. It was on the whole a rare amusement, which, continued too long, might have become a dissipation. Though I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all once, I hoed them unusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it in the end, “there being in truth,  as Evelyn says, “no compost or lætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion, repastination, and turning of the mould with the spade.  “The earth,  he adds elsewhere, “especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism in it, by which it attracts the salt, power, or virtue (call it either) which gives it life, and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about it, to sustain us; all dungings and other sordid temperings being but the vicars succedaneous to this improvement.  Moreover, this being one of those “worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath,  had perchance, as Sir Kenelm Digby thinks likely, attracted “vital spirits  from the air. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0011">During the summer days when some of my peers focused on fine arts in Boston or Rome, contemplation in India, or business in London or New York, I, like other New England farmers, dedicated my time to agriculture. It wasn't that I needed beans to eat, as I'm naturally a vegetarian when it comes to beans, whether for food or voting, and I traded them for rice. But perhaps, as some must work in the fields, if only for the sake of metaphors and expression, to one day serve a storyteller. Overall, it was an unusual pastime that, if continued too long, could have become a distraction. Although I didn't fertilize them and only hoed them once, I tilled them exceptionally well and was rewarded in the end. As Evelyn says, "there is truly no compost or manure whatsoever comparable to this constant motion, digging, and turning of the soil with a spade." He also notes, "The earth, especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism that attracts the salt, power, or virtue (whatever you call it) that gives it life, and is the reason for all the work and effort we put into it to sustain ourselves; all other fertilizing and sordid tampering are merely substitutes for this improvement." Moreover, this field, being one of those "worn-out and exhausted lay fields enjoying their sabbath," had possibly, as Sir Kenelm Digby believes, attracted "vital spirits" from the air. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0047">This is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant the common small white bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart, being careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed. First look out for worms, and supply vacancies by planting anew. Then look out for woodchucks, if it is an exposed place, for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and again, when the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice of it, and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting erect like a squirrel. But above all harvest as early as possible, if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you may save much loss by this means.</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0047">Here is what I've learned about growing beans. Plant the common small white bush bean around June 1st, in rows three feet apart and eighteen inches between plants. Be sure to choose fresh, round seeds that are all the same type. Watch out for worms at first, and replant any missing spots. Then keep an eye out for groundhogs, especially in open areas, as they will nibble the young leaves and later cut off the new shoots and pods while sitting up like a squirrel. Most importantly, harvest as soon as you can to avoid frost and ensure a good, marketable crop. Doing this can prevent a lot of loss.</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0048">This further experience also I gained. I said to myself, I will not plant beans and corn with so much industry another summer, but such seeds, if the seed is not lost, as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, innocence, and the like, and see if they will not grow in this soil, even with less toil and manurance, and sustain me, for surely it has not been exhausted for these crops. Alas! I said this to myself; but now another summer is gone, and another, and another, and I am obliged to say to you, Reader, that the seeds which I planted, if indeed they <i>were</i> the seeds of those virtues, were wormeaten or had lost their vitality, and so did not come up. Commonly men will only be brave as their fathers were brave, or timid. This generation is very sure to plant corn and beans each new year precisely as the Indians did centuries ago and taught the first settlers to do, as if there were a fate in it. I saw an old man the other day, to my astonishment, making the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least, and not for himself to lie down in! But why should not the New Englander try new adventures, and not lay so much stress on his grain, his potato and grass crop, and his orchards,—raise other crops than these? Why concern ourselves so much about our beans for seed, and not be concerned at all about a new generation of men? We should really be fed and cheered if when we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities which I have named, which we all prize more than those other productions, but which are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air, had taken root and grown in him. Here comes such a subtile and ineffable quality, for instance, as truth or justice, though the slightest amount or new variety of it, along the road. Our ambassadors should be instructed to send home such seeds as these, and Congress help to distribute them over all the land. We should never stand upon ceremony with sincerity. We should never cheat and insult and banish one another by our meanness, if there were present the kernel of worth and friendliness. We should not meet thus in haste. Most men I do not meet at all, for they seem not to have time; they are busy about their beans. We would not deal with a man thus plodding ever, leaning on a hoe or a spade as a staff between his work, not as a mushroom, but partially risen out of the earth, something more than erect, like swallows alighted and walking on the ground:—</p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0048">This additional experience I also gained. I told myself I wouldn't plant beans and corn with such hard work next summer, but instead seeds like honesty, truth, simplicity, faith, innocence, and the like. I wanted to see if they would grow in this soil, even with less effort and fertilizer, and sustain me, as surely the soil hasn't been depleted for these crops. Alas! I said this to myself, but now another summer has passed, and another, and I must tell you, Reader, that the seeds I planted, if they were indeed the seeds of those virtues, were worm-eaten or had lost their life force, and so did not sprout. Usually people will only be as brave or timid as their fathers were. This generation is certain to plant corn and beans each year just as the Indians did centuries ago and taught the first settlers, as if it's destined. I saw an old man the other day, to my surprise, making the holes with a hoe for at least the seventieth time, and not for himself to lie in! But why shouldn't the New Englander try new things and not focus so much on his grain, potato, grass, and orchard crops—why not raise other crops? Why do we care so much about our beans for seed, but not at all about a new generation of people? We would truly be nourished and uplifted if, when meeting someone, we were certain to see that some of the qualities I mentioned, which we value more than those other crops, but which are mostly scattered in the air, had taken root and grown in him. Here comes such a subtle and indescribable quality, like truth or justice, even in the smallest amount or new form, along the way. Our ambassadors should be told to send home such seeds, and Congress should help spread them across the land. We should never stand on ceremony with sincerity. We should never deceive, insult, and reject each other due to our pettiness, if the core of worth and kindness were present. We shouldn't meet so hastily. I don't encounter most men at all, as they seem to lack time; they are occupied with their beans. We wouldn't always deal with a man plodding along, leaning on a hoe or spade as a walking stick during his work, not like a mushroom, but partly risen from the earth, a bit more than upright, like swallows landed and walking on the ground.</p>

      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0052">Ancient poetry and mythology suggest, at least, that husbandry was once a sacred art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us, our object being to have large farms and large crops merely. We have no festival, nor procession, nor ceremony, not excepting our Cattle-shows and so called Thanksgivings, by which the farmer expresses a sense of the sacredness of his calling, or is reminded of its sacred origin. It is the premium and the feast which tempt him. He sacrifices not to Ceres and the Terrestrial Jove, but to the infernal Plutus rather. By avarice and selfishness, and a grovelling habit, from which none of us is free, of regarding the soil as property, or the means of acquiring property chiefly, the landscape is deformed, husbandry is degraded with us, and the farmer leads the meanest of lives. He knows Nature but as a robber. Cato says that the profits of agriculture are particularly pious or just, (<i>maximeque pius quæstus</i>), and according to Varro the old Romans “called the same earth Mother and Ceres, and thought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life, and that they alone were left of the race of King Saturn. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0052">Ancient poetry and mythology hint that farming was once a sacred art, but we pursue it with irreverent haste, focused only on having big farms and harvests. We have no festivals, processions, or ceremonies - not even our farm shows and Thanksgivings - where the farmer expresses the sacredness of his work or is reminded of its holy origins. He's tempted by rewards and feasts. He doesn't sacrifice to Ceres and the Earth God, but to the devilish Plutus instead. Greed, selfishness, and a base habit we all have of seeing land as mere property have deformed the countryside, degraded farming, and left the farmer living the lowliest life. He sees Nature only as something to exploit. Cato says farming profits are uniquely pious or just, and Varro notes the ancient Romans "called the earth Mother and Ceres, believing that those who tilled it led a pious and useful life, and that they alone remained of King Saturn's people."</p>
      <p class="subsq original-text" data-text-version="original" id="orig-paragraph-0053">We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin <i>spica</i>, obsoletely <i>speca</i>, from <i>spe</i>, hope) should not be the only hope of the husbandman; its kernel or grain (<i>granum</i> from <i>gerendo</i>, bearing) is not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmer’s barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also. </p>
      <p class="subsq transformed-text hidden" data-text-version="transformed" id="trans-paragraph-0053">We often forget that the sun shines on our farms, grasslands and woods equally. They all reflect and absorb its rays the same, and the farms are just a small part of the magnificent view it sees each day. From its perspective, the whole earth is evenly tended like a garden. So we should accept its light and warmth with matching faith and generosity. What does it matter that I prize the seeds of these beans and gather them in autumn? This vast field I've gazed at for so long doesn't see me as its main grower, but looks past me to more nurturing forces that irrigate and make it lush. These beans yield crops I don't harvest. Don't they grow partly for groundhogs too? The wheat stalk (in Latin spica, archaically speca, from spe, hope) shouldn't be the farmer's only aspiration; its seed or grain (granum from gerendo, bearing) isn't all that it carries. How then can our harvest ever disappoint? Shouldn't I also delight in the plentiful weeds whose seeds fill the birds' pantry? It matters little in the end if the fields stock the farmer's storehouses. The true farmer will let go of worry, just as squirrels show no distress over whether the forests will yield nuts this year, and complete his toil each day, giving up any right to the fruits of his lands, and relinquishing in his heart not just his early harvest but his late one too.</p>
